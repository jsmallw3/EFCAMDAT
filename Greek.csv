      It's possible that Gavin's been cheating on Alana. The movie stars usually are unfaithful. Sometimes it's for good, other times, it's for advertising. So people don't forget them. If it's truth that Alana has sued him don't worry, he has enough money to afford the problem. If someone is framing him, it's also a kind of advertising. They'll together contradict the new with big smiles. I have heard that Alana's been tired of Gavin and she's looking for Brad Pitt.

      Hello  John I just heard the Home Improvement by Josh Woodward. The lyrics tell about the life one man who lost his house and his land in the countryand he movedin the city , in a new life style. This a acoustic song, the only music instrument is a guitar and  it has kind of  sentimental melody. The singer doesnt have much of a range and the tune isnt rhythmic so you cant dance it. Theres not much of a change in mood but it has  a nostalgia about the old way of life. Its a great song but only in the right time

      I love playings games. My favorite play is Poker. Poker is a kind of cards game. Is a play with many variations. The  objective of the game is for one player to win what is known as the pot at the end of the game. The winner is either the player with the best hand(card combination) or the best bluff(when a player with an inferior hand leads the other players to believe he has a good hand by raising the bet). The more rarely a combination arises, the higher it is ranked. The best combination of cards is the royal flush. A poker really makes you think.
