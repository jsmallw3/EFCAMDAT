      Dear Friend,When you come first to visit in Canada, You shouldn't yell down the street to a friend, You shouldn't also stay too late when visiting our neighbours, You shouldn't go out alone at night. There are few things that we should remember to do such as: We should always bring gifts when visiting someone's house, We should control our children because it's dangerous to let them play without our supervision. Thanks a lot and make it fun your time in Canada. I'll be waiting for you.

      There are a lot of people in the world and they speak to  different languages. They use different ways to communicate with each other or receive information. As for me, I have been learning English and I think I used to speak with Russian accent. Nowadays the international language is English and we know that it is divided into few dialects. I would like to introduce and share some interesting information. 5000 people were asked some questions about their attitudes to voice and British English accents. Can you imagine that 81% of them said &quot;yes&quot; to the question - Do you change your voice depending on who you are talking about. I was surprised when  saw the result of the survey, 45 % of  people dislike Liverpool accent, though popular Beatles came from this city. Most people have moderately strong accent. You can analyse this survey findings and make up your point of view about the accents.

      In my country, the education trend is to give written tests to students twice a year. Teachers give tests to students to make important decisions. The students will fail the grade if they fail the tests. I'm disagree with that, i think sometimes there's students who really smart in practical but they doesnt really good in writing they will failed the grade. Thats not fair. In my opinion, it's better that they make writting tests and also practical tests to make important decisions for the students.

      Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model. CSR is a process with the aim to increase responsibility for the company's actions and encourage a positive impact through its activities on the environment, consumers, employees, communities, stakeholders and all other members of the public sphere who may also be considered as stakeholders. I believe that companies should think about the profits of the company to fulfill the shareholder's interest. Moreover, companies must have responsibility to society. It is not only focus on the shareholders but also directors should also responsible to environment in running their business. One example to describe about CSR is Resort World Sentosa in Singapore. The company earn a lot of money every year, beside that they also care about environment in improving the lives of children and for, as well as developing their team members through work and play. Resorts World at Sentosa has made care for the community a cornerstone of its business philosophy. In their business, they continuously look towards green practices such as solar technology and tree conservation. They also care about Caring for the Poor and Needy and Advancing Worker's Welfare.%%

My country is being vigorous in fighting corruption, but there are still many who do not know or they have the wrong perception about corruption.
