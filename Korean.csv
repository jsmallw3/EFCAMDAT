      First, I think the best way to get experience is a work placement during the university break. I'm going to find out place(company) to get work experinece. Next, I'm going to get out into the world and learn about another culture & language. Another thing I serch and contact to Peace Corps to get voluteer careers because the volunteering is good way to improve a CV. The fourth stage of my plan is making a fantasy CV. Sounds like a great idea. Finally, I will practice doing job interview.

      Good morning, everyone. I am very happy to have this chance to give my presentation. Today I will share about TSC team FY13 review and FY14 objectives and goals. &quot;. OK, lets start. ? Let me introduce the outline first, my presentation will be given in five parts: the first part Team Role. And the second part relates SR Creation. In the third part, LP/MP Service Visit. And in the fourth part, Call Center ? Finally, FY14 Objectives and Goals Well, let's move on to the first part---TSC organization chart with Team role. In this part, I want to introduce TSC team members. SR Parks role is Excimer LP/MP Service and call center agent. Moving on next presentation of FY13 TSC team review about SR creation. As you can see on this presentation, TSC team has created about 110 SR in average. Total number of SR created are 1340. Regarding collection plan completeness, most of data are green, which means acceptable, but some red indicates that below its target. On this chart, I would like to tell you that the data is getting better and better. Lets look at the Next collection plan timeliness with range. This data is showing that upload data is getting shorter and shorter.%% Moving on next slides, lets review TSC teams LP/MP Service visit. This bar chart show that # of visits, labor hour, and travel hours. Q1, TSC team has field visit was 40 times per quarter, 237.5 hours labor and 206 travel hour. In total, TSC team has 111 of # of vist, 803.5 hour labor, 628h travel time. Lets look at the MP/LP visit and 1st time fix rate. According to this chart, TSC team has 82% of fix rate. As you know 1st time fix rate is fix the problem with first time service visit. Moving on to next presentation, regarding call center overview. We have 9 Call center agents with TSC and EO service. Lets look at call center answering rate result here. Most of month, the answering rate is over than its target, except April and May. On this period of time, service visit has extensively increased, On May, many engineer has oversea field visit and as a results the answering rate was lower than its target. From this low answering rate, we set up counter plan as control call center agents schedule, Training to call center agent. And requested to IT that call can be forward to agents mobile phone. This option is still waiting from IT. The good thing is that from june to September, we have good answering rate so far. Finally, TSC teams FY14 goal and objectives. Firstly, Excimer MP/LP one time resolutions target is higher than 85%. Second goal is call center answering rate is higher than 85% and increase of incoming call more than 100 call per months. Recently the coherent korea representative phone number has been set up of link to call center by IT, And this will be increase # of incoming call to call center. Third goal is Excimer data upload to CRM. Upload efsr on timely and its targets are below than 7 days and accuracy up to 90%. To achieve this goal, we need other Excimer service engineer help are necessary by sending service report on timely. Fourth goals are e-survey as return rate target as higher than 25%, and every by-weekly basis sent of e-survey. Last goal is Spare part quotation as minimize error on quotation. Thats all for today! Thanks!

      I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B.
