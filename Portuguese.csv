      Im always been a firm believer that our planet needs help. Every day Earth continues being destroyed. We don't care about the environment when using fossil fuels, dumping garbage through the nature and destroying forests to the livestock.We dont need to be heroes to do something. Lets start with our city, changing our sources of energy.I believe that, if we use the energy with care, we can avoid the waste. And, without waste, we can use other sources of energy, like the wind power, that is the conversion of wind energy into electricity, using turbines. As you know, in our city, wind is always present. All we need is the wind turbines.As far as Im concerned, with US$ 80.000,00 we can finish the construction of these turbines and the transmission facilities. There are no fuel costs, and the maintenance costs are low.I agree all those turbines are not so beautiful, but we can put them in places where there aren't so many visitors. Even though the landscape become uglier, our planet will thank us.

      Youll never believe this. Im a pilot, and this is a history the older pilots always tell us. Some years ago, two fighter pilots were in two aircraft, flying together. It was raining and they were running out of fuel, that means one hadnt enough fuel to wait the landing of the other, so they decided to proceed with a land with wingman. Because of the rain, it was hard to see the runway, and everything happened really fast. They landed out of the runway, the landing gear of them broke and one stopped far away from the other. The fire-fighter truck came fast to one aircraft, in order to rescue the pilot, but he was pretty fine. The most incredible thing happened then. The pilot, worried about his friend, climbed into the truck and asked to the fire-fighter to go fast until the other aircraft. During the path, the pilot fell out of the truck and became injured, with his leg broken. His friend, the other pilot, was watching the scene, much better than his hasty friend.

      1. Introduction: Josh Woodward, Home Improvement.2. The song: an unhappy lyric about Americas's consumer today's society. There is a full arrangement, not just a singer with his guitar. The news is an older style American folk, different from songwriter's dark style. 3. Impression: although it is a negative theme about the singer-songwriter background, the song is enjoyable and has a beautiful and original melody.4. Conclusion: this different style could not be all fans' taste, but it is a special and professional song about an important feeling of lost. Is worth listening to it a lot of times!

      Hello, First of all, I am very glad in is writing to magazine. Thanks a lot. Then, I've researched and studied a lot about what people think about how their lives will be different in 20 years from now. Nowadays, we live with different weather. We live with some natural disasters. It's very difficult live thereby. Moreover, we have violence, conflicts and others things. I think that our world won't be so different as now because many people have different reason about future or don't think about it. Now, we work a lot. It's a workaholic. There are diffirentes things as mobile phone and cars, for example. They are fantastic. However, we don't care about environment and global warning. Future? I think not. We must educate ourselves and learn to plant( learn about environment) now to reap good fruits in the future. We have to think in our planet. In 20 years, the rivers, forests, weather, people, musics won't be the same, of course. But, can be wonderful, if we think now our way of thinking and acting! Thanks a lot, Heilan Farias.

      I would like to study the University of Economics, because after finishing it I would have two qualifications, computer specialist and engineer of economy. The second school is very good too, because I would have a complex overview in computers. During the studies I would like to join some exchange program for students and study few months abroad. It would be absolutely perfect, because of get some experience with foreign circumstances. Next aim I would like to achieve is to learn fluently English and German. Its necessary, because we are surrounded by German speaking countries and the official language in the European Union is the English.After the school I would like to find well paid work, but I would have to enjoy it. In the work which I dont enjoy I dont do maximum for it and its not good. After get some experience If possible I would like to create my own computer company, because what I know certain is that I dont want to work with some company and after fifty years they will tell me By Mike, you were good, but we dont need you anymore. Thats my nightmare.I want to leave some product of my whole life work here. I exactly dont know the specialization of my future company, but I would like to undertake in the computer world, because it has a future. Thats another reason why I would like to study the University of Economics.  For choice I would like to undertake with my present friends, because I can believe them and they will study similar schools. I believe that would be successful company and we would earn a lot of money. I would buy a comfortable car and I would buy a land and built a big house with an indoor and outdoor swimming pool.  The bases for a good life are the material resources and a life partner. I dont enjoy the marriage so I would like to live with my partner without it at least until the time we would have children, because its not necessary for me to have an affirmation which allows me to live with somebody I love. I think that it is a modern tendency to live without a marriage, so I would try it. I suppose that people will come to know each other better. After I will have children I would like to look after my family, so the conditions is that the company will be reputable and it will be run by perspective people and I will only share the profits and do only the representative functions as propagations of our interests.

      LET THE RIGHT ONE IN115 min - Drama/HorrorLet the Right One In is a masterpiece from the swedish director Tomas Alfredson. Based on the novel of the same name, by John Ajvide Lindqvist, the plot shows the story of Oscar, a bullied 12-year-old boy who met a girl (a child vampire) who moved to his building and starts to help Oscar to defeat his bully enemies from the school. Meanwhile, both starts to falling in love each other. Different from all other vampire movies, in a cold place and with a stunning picture, Let the Righ One In is a sensible and artistic movie, with breathless performances from the kids. Theres an american remake made on 2010, but definitely, the original is just superior in all aspects.

      First of all, we have two demographic groups that Ive been analyzing. Demographic group one is composed of 15 to 19-year-old women and 29% purchase at least on magazine a month. In addition, 69% prefer magazines to blogs. Demographic group two is composed of 18 to 24-year-old men and 47% purchase at least one magazine a month. However, 72% prefer magazines supporter by extensive website content. The purchasing power of demographic group one will rise dramatically from 2010 to 2025. Contrastingly, demographic group two will have a slow rise in their purchasing power. Furthermore, there will be a sharp rise in demographic group one between 2010 and 2025. In contrast, the demographic group two will fall steadily until 2025. In the end, the pros of expanding into demographic group one is that the population and its purchasing power will increase as the years pass. The cons is that today they dont purchase a good number of magazines a month and there are already 6 competitors on that group. Thats the opposite of demographic group two, that will decrease in quantity and purchasing power but today have a good number of buyers and few competitors.

      Hi, TimWhat a nice experience you had! So I have one too: when I went to the Island of Honey, in Brazil. The Island of Honey is a nature reserve. There was not electricity. At night we walked with flashlight. Is forbidden to come in by car, by motorcycle or other type of motor, only on foot. The island is 22 square kilometers and we know it all in four days. My sisters and I had a wonderful days of the sun, beach, walking and fun! But when we were coming back, walking on the beach to quay to take the boat to continent ,the weather changed, a tropical storm was coming and the sea was rough. We had to left the island quickly because the water could flood the island. We were worried about this, but we got arrive at the continent before the storm.Hugs.

      Ridley Scott's &quot;Prometheus&quot;is a magnificent science-fiction film, all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life and doesn't have the answers. It's in classic tradition of golden age sci-fi, echoing Scott's &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), but creating a world of it's own. A scene at the outset shows a world with apparently only one animal being, a pale humanoid who stalks a high ridge surrounded by spectacular scenery. This person eats something that causes painful vomiting and rapid body decay. The vomit is followed into flowing water, where it seems to morph into living cellular structures. Where is the place? Is it Earth? Who is the being, and why is it alone and naked? Is the scene a visualization of the theory that life first arrived on earth from outer space.

First of all, research indicates that the men''s group purchase at least one magazine a month, against just 29% of women''s group. For the group 1 the market already has 6 competitive products while the competition for the second group shows 1 long term and 2 recent competitive products.Considering the Growth in group 2 will continue to rise strongly through 2025, the marketing department can project the future trends to be focused on an increased interest in men''s magazines.In addition, our products has been developed especially for men the last 5 years.Because of this, I think we are way ahead of the competition. There are some issues, however. Our competitor has been in this market for decades and they are expecting to spend over 2.5 million on advertising.

Despite the fact of the actors being human persons, with the support of the modern technology they became people totally different once we are talking about foreign planet.

Claude Monet was a impressionist, he painted the famous 'The Road Bridge at Argenteuil' in 1874, is a painting outside, which feature the boats on the River Seine. The expressionists were separate in two groups: The Bridge and The Blue Riders, famous artists of the Blue Rider included Franz Marc, Paul Klee, and Wassily Kandinsky. 'The Blue Rider' was painted by Franz Marc. Marc used to painting horses and other animals. His techniques were with bold colors, he tried this way capture the primitive energy of animals.Cubism was inspired by Picasso in Spanish and Braque in Paris, in this movement everything is reduced to geometrical forms, the intent is show multiple viewpoints of one figure.

Research indicates that 29% of women and 47% of men purchase at least one magazine a month. 69% of women prefers magazines to blogs, in comparison, 72% of men prefers magazines supported by extensive website content. Womens purchasing power will increase 22 billion. Likewise, growth in this demographic is estimated in 6 million. In contrast, mens demographic size will decrease 5 million and their purchasing power will increase only 2 billion. As you can see, the mens market is stagnant. In addition, there are three competitive products. If we expand into this market, the future trends appear to be focused in a new concept magazine with brief subjects, supported by extensive website content. It would be more compact, cheaper and accessible from any gadget. On the one hand, the womens market is in a steadily rise, but on the other hand, there are six competitive products. If we expand to this market, a quality content magazine would be definitive to increase our sales, although it would be more expensive.

In an informal meeting a kiss in the cheek is appropriate. The number of kisses is different from state to state: in Rio de Janeiro it is two, in So Paulo it is one and in Rio Grande do Sul it is three. The finger circle or the ok sign is considered an insult.Make business appointments in advance and being punctual is recommended, but not a must.Services charges shouldnt be included in restaurant bills, the waiter will ask you if he can charge 10% for his service. In cabs, tipping is optional. Theres no extra tax for carrying bags or suitcases.You can call the Brazilians by their first names. In a formal meeting, the use of Mr. and Mrs. is considered respectful. I hope these tips were helpful. If I wasnt clear at some point, feel free to ask me. Evelyn

      Hi, dear Renee. I''m impressed with the viewing figures. People really are watching more TV in the last years. However, in my region, people under about 18 prefer access pages on the web or to play videos games instead to watch TV. The ratings show that people of my age group (19 - 30) prefer to watch sitcoms. it''s true, this kind of movie is among my favorites. I don''t like either talk shows or reality TV.

      Dear Sir, I have no doubt the three ones have an interesting message and strong appeal, but considering market aspects, I choose the second one. There are many ways to present Century, however, which one is the most applicable? Certainly, we need avoid to focus in a minority as, for instance, beauty or rich people. The best way to touch majority expectations is, conclusively, to develop our campaign centered on glamour. The glamour expresses the desire of all social classes, cultures and ages. The glamour attracts all kind of public. We will have the conditions to plan and launch a massive campaign, in all media ways. Despite the fact the Century is a well-known brand, we will have a significant opportunity to have the Centurys market share increased. Is an important opportunity to show our way to promote this famous brand, demonstrating our work potencial. If will remain any doubt, please contact me. Sincerely, Lastname

On the other hand, humans need to be equal others humans, for this reason, everybody needs to get married, has children, etc. Me, as everybody, want to the same.

      Dear Sir or Madam, My friend Meg was the victim of a strange and disturbing event, and I think is appropriate to come here to summarize it for knowledge of all readers of this valuable newspaper. And, if you give me your permission, Ill try to do it the best way I can.She was going out to work as usual round about eight in that beautiful sunny morning. When she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fouth, she saw a young couple get out of a car, and suddenly they began vandalizing the local newsagents. They were breaking the window with a hammer, and throwing paint on the store front. She didnt know what to do but as good citizen she decided to go over them to see if she could get them to stop. Suddenly the young woman came at my friend waving a gun! And she pushed the gun into my friends stomach, and start talking very fast about consumerism and the evil of the modern world! Try to imagine how astonished my friend was then. She was shaking so much, and the young woman was talking so quickly tha my friend couldnt understand her. My friend was comprehensively completely terrifying: you dont wake up in the morning and expect something like that to happen to you.Finally, to cut a long story short, a passer-bye, a young and strong guy, came at where my friend was  and the young woman ran off down the street, not before this guy grabbed her hair, at which point it came off in his hands! Turns out it was a wig! And the young woman wasnt a young woman at all, but a teenage boy.They havent caught the couple yet, and its worring to think about them still out there.What a complicated world we live!Francisco Fagundes

Meg went to into The Coffee Pot, and as usually she came out carrying the coffee in one hand, her laptop in the other and the handbag over her shoulder. When she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, something very unusual happened. She saw a young couple getting out of a car, while they were talking about contemporary problems as air pollution and noise. Suddenly, they started vandalizing the local newsagents without any apparent reason! She was shocked with that situation. So, innocently she tried to stop them, but the young woman was very angry and pushed a gun! My friend might have been killed! Suddenly the the young woman grabbed the laptop and ran off the street. A passer-by saw what was happening and caught her by the hair. You can't believe what surprise they had when her hair came off in the man's hands. Turns out it was a wig!  She astounded that a perfect normal day could turn out like this dramatic event.

She deserved an honest, an hard-working and loyal man like you Doug. It is great to see such an affectionate, devoted and supportive couple like you two.

This morning was a sunny morning around 8 o'clock. She left her house and went into The Coffee Pot for have a breakfast when suddenly she listened a noise. Some guys broke the window with a hammer and they drove for a bookstore for to break other windows. This moment one young woman came at my friend waving a gun. She pushed the gun into her stomach, and started talking very fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world. It was astonishing! My friend was shaking so much, and after a passer -by, a nice handsome looking guy she remember, chased the young woman and caught her by the hair. Somehow she managed to escape. But not before this guy grabbed her hair, at which point it came off in his hands! Turns out it was a wig. And the young woman wasn't a young woman at all, but a teenage boy. My friend was scared to leave the house but at the finished everything was all right. Thank God!

So comparing how long we watch TV and what kind of programs the survey indicates as most popular, we will know if we are as  major  people or if we are different of the majority. Is  possible to conclude if we watch TV to be informed or to be relaxed. What are your results? I'm curious. Hugs, Charlot Souza.

      Hi Sir or Madam,Ive been planning to buy a house. So, Ive been saving money and balancing my budget. As you can see in the documents, I can pay for a loan. I work in the public service and I have a $3000 income. Now, that my grandparents died, I have the opportunity to buy their house. It is an old big house, but they had refurbished it 2 years ago. Although, I need a mortgage. Thats the reason Im requesting you to consider the finance. So, I am able to pay $1000 per month and Im thinking to use $100.000 from my savings. So, I still need more $100.000 to buy the house. Im waiting for the answer. Otherwise, contact me for more information: xxx@myemail.com or ## ## ####-####.Sincerely,Charlot Souza.

      Hello kids, today we are going to learn a new game. It's called Frisbee Bowling. You have to knock down these bowling pins in your turn. I have just filled them with some water just to make the game a little bit harder. During your turn you have to throw two frisbees and if you knock down all pins I'll give you more two shots. Each knocked down pin will score one point. The winner is the one who has more points in the end of the game. Lets begin!

Can you imagine that 81% of them said &quot;yes&quot; to the question - Do you change your voice depending on who you are talking about. I was surprised when saw the result of the survey, 45 % of people dislike Liverpool accent, though popular The Beatles came from this city. Other interesting question was what accent do people prefer. 60%% prefered Standard English. The Most people have moderately strong accent. You can analyse this survey findings and give your opinion.

      In 21st Century, unfortunately we still saw many types of discriminations, such as sex discrimination.Thanks to the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975, that applies to all discrimination in the workplace, discrimination has been more controled or it has happened in indirect way that applies to policies and practices that, in reality, favor one gender considerably more than another - although, on the surface, they seem to apply to both sexes equally.When talking about business discriminations, women are in general victim.At the presente time, direct sex discrimination is the most common type that happens in business. Is when an employer treats a woman less favorably than a man. Unlawful harassment and victimization are common too.So I would make a research by asking people if:- Do you have already have been discriminated?- Do the cause was age, gender or marital status?- Do you brought a discrimination claim?- Where you a victim?

      Is hard to believe but in the middle of the 21st Century there are still cases of sex discrimination. Although there are laws to guarantee that sex discriminations dosen't happen, many woman seems to struggle to deal with this situations. The law is very clear when categorizes the discrimation in direct, indirect, deliberate and accidental. If anyone feel like being victim of sex discrimination the right think to do is face the situation, overcome the fear and report what is happening. Depending on the intensity and on who is the abuser, it's possible that the situation can be solved inside the work enviroment. Many companies offer internal ways you can denounce others employees. But if this alternative is not enough, the victim must go to the police and use the laws to punish the offender.

So, I took the train nearby my house and went to the inner toward the mountains where our farm is located.I arrived early morning at my destination, and immediately went to meet my parents. When I came there, they were shocked with my presence. My impression was that they were seeing a ghost. It was too strange for me, I was waiting that they would do a big commemoration when they saw me, but instead, they remain paralyzed looking me stunned.Passed a few minutes, they told me that in the last night my grandmother dreamed that I was coming there to visit them, and that I was bringing with me one bouquet of yellow roses to gift her. Thus, was me who was scared, because on my backpack I was really bringing a small bouquet of yellow roses that I bought on the train platform in the day before!Well, I dont know explain how this strange 'coincidence' - or whatever name that we can call this  happened, but we all thought very curious this fact of premonition! In the end, everything ran in an excellent way. And when I was returning to my home, on the train my mind was remaining thinking about my grandmother's dream.

We found the murder weapon - a jewel-encrusted dagger - in the trash outside. The windows were broken, and the house's owner reported a few stolen jewelry, one of which we found in the woman's pockets. After a little search, we found signs of another person in the house. It was like they fought over the stolen goods, and the woman got murdered. But them we discovered the woman was one of two heirs of a elderly oil tycoon! I know it was real life, but couldn't help thinking 'the plot thickens!'. Turns out that the murder was the other heir, who was drowned in debts, and got caught by the elderly woman's bodyguards after he attempted against her life two days later.

      As in other contries, in my country, Brazil, there's some polemics laws. For exemple, here there's not life imprisionment or death penalty. The maximum time that a person may be arrested is thirty years. Many people are against and many people are in favor. I'm in favor life imprisionment because there're some people without condition to live in society but I don't agree  death penalty. It's very radical method. Other polemic subject is age of criminal. Persons under eighteen are considered unimputable. They only fulfill education measures in close regime and after completing eighteen, they are released. I'm totaly against this. Teens, sometimes, commit horrible crimes, and this already happened, but the law isn't efficient to punish this. Finally, law of disarmament: A few years ago, there was a plebiscite to define if citizens can have weapons. The majority of the population approved the right to posses weapon, but the law to possess guns is extremely rigid. I'm totally against people having guns because having a gun at home cause many tragic accidents.

      Green business is very important to the world.  Whenever possible, I look for environmentally friendly product but, unfortunatelly, there are very few available and in most cases more expensive than others. I think that even truly green companies take advantage to profit more. In Brazil, some kinds if products are environmentally friendly: all dish detergent, all washing powder (theyre biodegradable), all toilet paper, all towel paper (theyre made from reforested wood) and its not more expensive. On the other hand, other products is very expensive like: organics vegetables, biodegradable bags, solar panels, ecological leather... Sometimes, I think companies explore our concern about the environment, because I dont understand why the most of these products are so expensive. I guess to encourage consumption, theyre should be the same price than others. I dont believe that companies spend much more to do this environmentally friendly products. Im very sad about this situation. Is still far from a true raise awareness of all companies to the problem of the environment.

      In Brazil, crimes happen every day, but the big problem is impunity. Often criminals are encouraged to continue in the world of crime for that reason. We are currently experiencing a demonstration of impunity. Politicians who were condemned by justice, manage privileges that ordinary prisoners fail. This is very sad, because the symbol of justice is a blindfolded woman. Crimes committed by politicians involving public money should be punished with the highest accuracy , because it acts of educated people and they know well what they are doing and do it because they want to do . It is different from a simple thief who stole to feed his family . Whens the politicians get involved in crime , they steal million of the population . This takes away the right to health, safety and education of many people. Thus, if they are not punished, others believe they can do the same, because we live in a democracy and everyone has the same rights and duties.

      The installation of big-box stores has both pros and cons. In my opinion, we must have to be realistic and choose the best to the economy, society and environment. If we are talking about a village or a small town, maybe the installation of a big-box store will improve its economy and will help to develop the citizens. Generally, small town and village have one or two big-box store and a lot of small business. If we are talking about big city, it's very common to find a big-box store in each corner. In my city, we have a lot of these type of business. Superstores encourage us to develop our economy and a lot of families need them, but depends on what you will work there, they will pay a ridiculous wage. I understand that for us is very easy to buy our things in a big-box store, because it's very convenient to find everything you want in a single store. In the other hand, we have to analyse if these superstores will decrease the economy of local small business. Like we say in Brazil, it's a two-way street.

      Hi Anna! I heard you are searching a new job, and I found a job that perfectly fits you! It's for a zookeeper, what you'll only need to do is prepare some food and feed the animals. Sounds absolutely amazing, since you like animals so much. I really think you should apply for it. Your salary will be $50,000 + benefits, such as full accident insurence, 1 month holiday every year and regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles... That's very exhilarating. So, please, I urge you to apply for this. It's a really fun job and I think it will be, by far, the most interesting you've ever had. Cheers, Jaque

      You guys will never believe what happened to me on my flight. You know what a grumpy flier I am, too, so youll all find this super entertaining, Im sure. Im sitting on my plane from Hartford to New Orleans. I have an aisle seat, of course, and Im hoping its not a full flight. Yeah, right. Its practically standing room only, and I can feel the plane getting warmer as passengers pack in like sardines. There are few things worse than being trapped in a metal container with 200 of your closest sweaty friends. A splitting headache and a spoiled appetite means Im about as warm and pleasant as a female anglerfish. A father walks up the aisle with a kid who looks to be about three. I can tell the kids going to be trouble, because the dad seemed to be struggling against a tide of I dont wannas and you cant make mes. I look to my left and see the empty seats. Please please please dont let them sit next to me. They stop directly in front of my row, and I realize my prayers are going unanswered. Just my luck. I stand up to let them through.%% He plops his daughter down in the window seat to keep her happy and edges into the middle seat. I do my best to avoid eye contact, but the little girl starts kicking the seat in front of her, and I look at her dad. He gives me a halfhearted what can you do?-type of smile, and I turn away. Do not smile at me, sir. I am not in the mood. And I have a feeling the guy in front of your daughter isnt in the mood either. I dig out my headphones and jam them into my ears, which I thought was the international signal for Dont try to make small talk with me because although these headphones make me seem super interesting, I cant hear anything youre saying. Unfortunately, nobody read this guy in on the rules. I pick up by book and try to find my place, dreading the moment he will inevitably try to converse with me, and then I hear it: Thats an awfully big book! I pause, look up, and slowly turn my head to the left. Eyebrows raised, I pointedly remove the right earbud, pause, and say, Whats that? with an obviously forced smile. Not exactly light reading, and he gestures toward Anna Karenina. No, its not. Its pretty tough, actually...requires a lot of concentration. I put my earbud back in and turn away. Where you headed? Oh, yes. Awesome. Super. Weve got a talker. An oblivious talker. Someone give this guy a megaphone so everyone can hear him talking. No one shall be spared. New Orleans, I say with almost a maniacal smile this time, flicking my head in his direction dramatically, then back down just as quicklythis time without removing my earbuds. Oh, Ive been there! Now hes going to proceed to tell me why he was there, who he knows there, what they did there, what they ate, how they were feeling, what shoes he was wearing. Then hes going to ask why Im going there. Hes going to be surprised when I tell him Im from there and ask why I left and how I chose my college and what I studied and what I do now and how Im liking it and all the polite conversation youre supposed to make with a plane passenger who does not have headphones in. I have to potty! My left eye twitches. The kid...Id almost forgotten about the kid. She wriggles out of her seatbelt and rests her sticky little face on Dads shoulder before saying again, this time louder and in his ear (just in case he didnt hear), I have to potty!! Ugh, I just took you! says Dad, unbuckling his seat belt and grabbing hold of her hand. Theyre gone for a few peaceful minutes, and I make it about a page before they return. I get up, they file in, Dad orders a beer and an orange juice for the tiny child. Im thinking I might need something a bit stronger to get through this flight. What happens next is the truly horrifying part. She sets her sights on the middle seat, and she is going to do anything to get it. She wriggles out of her seatbelt, nearly choking herself in the process, and I can feel her tiny little hands on my leg as she worms her way beneath her fathers tray table. She squeezes herself between her father and myself and climbs up on my lap, staring at her father until hes forced to take the window seat. I am paralyzed. You guys know how I feel about children. Dad says nothing of the fact that his offspring has climbed up onto a strangers lap. I stare at him bewildered as he moves over, leans on the window, and drinks his beer. Then, the child looks up at me. I look down at her. The exchange lasts forever. Why isnt she moving? Shes just sitting there. I scoop her up out of my lapshe cant be more than 30 poundsand plop her into the middle seat. Dad does nothing, so I buckle her seatbelt, pop in my headphones, and attempt to read. Lady, whatcha readin? It speaks... The tiny girl is staring up at me. I tell her its a story about sad Russians. She asks why theyre sad, and I tell her its because they dont like the snow. (I dont think three-year-olds really understand the concepts of betrayal and political intrigue.) She picks up the planes menu and asks what I want. I stare blankly. She repeats the question, pointing to an array of drinks available to order. I point at the soda. She pinches at the glossy page, pretending to pick up the tiny graphic of a bottle, and shoves her tiny thumb and forefinger in my mouth, no doubt pretending to somehow feed me the soda. She extracts her hand and picks up the SkyMall magazine as I stare straight ahead, horrified that the tiny child has just put her grubby, sticky fingers into my mouth. I think about where those hands have been and what diseases she just passed onto me. I imagine she has some kind of mutated strand of the bubonic plague, to which only she is immune. Great, Im going to bring about an epidemic caused by a child sticking her hands in my mouth. These are going to be the most embarrassing Patient Zero interviews ever. Ugh ugh ugh. I wipe my mouth instinctively. We finally land, and the lady sitting a row behind me catches my eye and says smiling, You were so good with her. Not many people have that kind of patience. I smile and laugh weakly, grab my purse and book it. Next time, Im bringing a blanket and will just straight-up drape it over my head. No sense trying to pretend Im normal. Not if the reward is being force-fed imaginary bottles of soda.

      Currently, I work as a sociologist, I'm really happy with this profession, bur I receive low wages. Therefore, I set my sights higher and after finishing my bachelor's I intender to apply for diplomatic career. Prior to that, I was an intern at a high school. Afterwards I graduated at Federal University of Sergipe, in Brazil, and started to work as a researcher and teacher. Nowadays, I'm studying international politics contents in order to achieve enough background to work in foreign affairs. Sounds a little bit arrogant, but I think I'm clever enough to pull it off. Nevertheless, It is not easy following my dreams because economy is bad, and I have to work hard to maintain my studies and way of life. Despite these problems, I'm a goal oriented and think-skinned guy when the subject is personal career in order to avoid waste of time. I know that I'm not as tough as my friends make out, but It is pretty important trying tough me up so that I can overcome obstacles more easily. The bottom of line is that I want to be successful in everything that I do in my life either as a sociologist or a diplomat.%%

The food was simple but very sophisticated. We didnt have dessert, because it wasnt a local tradition.

      In our Museum, you can experience the most interesting pieces of European Art. In order to help you locate yourself, we divided this brochure accordingly to the wings. 1- The Impressionist Wing It will be exhibit from September 15th to January 30th.  This movement started in Paris, in a reaction to a very formal and rigid style of painting. Impressionists painters prefered painting the outside and study the effect of natural light on the objects. One example is this painting, called &quot;The Road Bridge at Argenteuil&quot; by Claude Monet, from 1874. It's part of our permanent collection. It's painted outside and shows features boats on the River Seine. Monet used many techniques of the Impressionits on this painting:  - Used complementary colors (blue/ orange and green/ red) - Used soft and small strokes of different tints and shades to create the quiet movement of the water - tried to capture the effects of light in the atmosphere by applying finger colors in the sky 2- The Expressionist Wing The show goes from August 12th to October 1st. The Expressionist movement were organized by two German groups: The Bridge and The Blue Riders.%% Some of The Blue Riders artists included Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.  Example from this group is &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; by Franz Marc, also part of our permanent collection. He was dedicated on painting horses and others animals. His compositions were erratical, he experimented with bold colors and tried to capture the primitive energy of animals.  The movement ended with the beginning of WW1.  3- The Cubist Wing The show goes from October 1st to March 21st.  The Cubism were initiated by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and French artist Braquet, in Paris. In this movement, everything is reduced to geomatrical forms and fragmentation figures. It seems that several aspects of one object are shown simultaneously. It's considered a forerunner of Abstract Art.  One piece of this movement, part od our permanent collection, is &quot;Le Jour&quot; by George Braque, from 1929. It's a still life done in greens, grays, ochers and browns. It shows various objects such as a jar, a knife, a violin and an open drawer fragmented, as if seen from multiple points of view. The items are fragmented, but on the other hand, it has a well balanced composition.  We hope you can enjoy our exhibition and we hope to sse you soon!

      In my country the rules are a little differents, for example, here in Brazil you can't have a gun, it's permitted only for people that need it to work, like a police officer for example.  Is completely unbelivable a person have a gun like in USA, here the law is completely different in this point. In my opinion, I agree that people don't have a gun, I think that's more safety for us this way. Here in Brasiz is not permitted smoke in a restaurant, is not considareted polite to do this, so people usually don't smoke in restaurants. In brazil there is a law that say that a man can't dating with a girl that doesn't have at least 18 years, they will be permitted dating only if your parents agree with the dating. In my opion this law is good because here in Brazil sometimes happens sexual abuse against girl, so this help against this type of action.

But, the ritmo this music was cool. Is lively and makes you want to dance. I didn't understand  the lyric this music, I found a little confusing. The singer is well, knows how to follow the melody of the song. Anyway, I prefer other tune of music, for example, I like to eletronic music. But, for to dance, I prefer dance music and hip-hop.

      Gender equality is still a very complicated topic in Brazil? Absolutely yes. Men occupy the most important roles, gain much more prominence in whatever position they exercise. Women who are able to stand out from the artistic, the singing, acting, dance, among others. Nowadays things go changing a bit here, women are starting to gain ground in positions that were previously called &quot;masculine&quot;, and even the country's president is a woman! We must increasingly strive and show that we are able yes making any kind of thing, without the help of men and impose us more in the middle of business. Nowadays most of the senior positions in the country, still remain with men, although women have gained a larger space in the labor market.

Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materail in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy gren products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food.  Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, wich is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      NETWORK OF STORES ADOPT POLICY EMPLOYEE BENEFITS &nbsp; Magazine Luiza grants financial aid for moms, daycare assistance and scholarships One of the goals of an employee is to be treated well by the head and, of course, have a good salary. Marcio Antonio da Silva, villager St. Peter in St. Bernard can say that accomplished that goal. It integrates the sales team of the newly opened Magazine Luiza, street Marshal Diodorus, one of 10 companies that offer benefits to employees in Brazil. &quot;Here at the store we are all equal, we can say that we are the owners of the store. We had lunch all together from the lowest to the highest office ,&quot;said the salesman, who started work last Monday ( 22 / 09 ), but was in training for three months. These benefits were the factors that attracted Marcio to try a spot in the company.&quot; The cool benefit is the program goal, every card that we do receive a value as a reward&quot; he said. Another seller of Sao Bernardo shop, Juliana Pedrosa Rodrigues, mother of a young son, also said that a benefit provided by the company called attention to jobs.&quot; The check mother (aid from $ 200 to employees who have children) help me pay for my son's school, and that when he enters college the company may also pay the tuition of the course,&quot; he said .%% The Director of Human Resources (HR) Telma Rodrigues, ensures that the HR strategy is critical to the company's evolution. &quot; The sale process requires a lot of determination of the employees so that they can meet the needs of customers. In this sense , we have a philosophy that values ??all employees and gives them real opportunities for growth, &quot; said the director. Among the many benefits that the company offers are scholarships for all types of training; monthly allowance from $ 250 to pay for daycare - for employees who have children up to 10 years; overdraft - education for parents who have children with disabilities of any age , and health plan that extends in-laws, in-law, fathers, mothers, brothers, are examples of some of the benefits granted to employees of Magazine Luiza. Is for these reasons that I think the big retail stores a great company type. For it is through them that many people have the chance of a decent and happy life.

      Green business is importante to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable material in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot of more for certain items. It's not Always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

I spoke English every day after school as I played with the children in my neighborhood. We sang songs and played games, all in English. I was keen to learn because it helped me make friends I neer would have had. I soon realized that English also gave me better opportunities in life. I was accepted at Duke university in the US, which is a well-respected school. A major reason I was accepted was because I was fluent in English. I think that the university appreciated that am also fluent in Spanish, my native tongue. After I graduated fron Duke, I moved back to Spanish to be with my family.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentaly friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materiais in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products im my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries im my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the products is truly green, which is wy I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Petty crimes in the Brazil may include purse-snatching or shoplifting. Many petty crimes in the Brazil are punished with fines although some people may lose privileges, including a professional licence. If you are sentenced to jail for a petty crime, you might be incarcerated for one year or less. Youth aged 18 and under are send to juvenile detention. This is true for most of the country, unless you live in certain states, like Rio de Janeiro, where the maximum is 2,5 years. After punishment, may petty crimes can be erased from a person's criminal record so that the individual can lead a normal life. However, some more serious crimes, like drunk driving, cannot. Theses types of cases need to remain on record in case there is recidivism. Generally, petty crime, is considered less serious. The court delivers a minor punishment mainly so that the individual will admit he or she has made a mistake and think twice before committing another crime. The hope is that the individual will be rehabilitated.

      Hello Ian, I think you have two big problems: claustrophobia and a possibility to lose your job. What do think about those two questions? What is the worst? I think its necessary work because you must sustain you and your family. In the other hand, I think it would very good if you could control your claustrophobia. I know, your problem is a real problem, it runs in your blood, but its possible to control. Dont panic, go to the doctor. Theres a treatment: CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) where the doctor go with you to the claustrophobic locals and make you feel. If its necessary, you can use some medication for a period of time to control some symptoms like anxiety or heart brought. Good luck! Ronaldo

      To create a successful and organized project and solid teamwork, I propose that companies use the PDCA analysis techique. Is an iterative four steps management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products. Each one means: PLAN Establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with the expected goals. By establishing output expectations, the completeness and accuracy of the specification is also a part of the targeted improvement. When possible start on a small scale to test possible effects. DO Implement the plan, execute the process. CHECK Study the actual results and compare against the expected results to ascertain any differences. Look for deviation in implementation from the plan and also look for the appropriateness and completeness of the plan to enable the execution. ACT Request corrective actions on significant differences between actual and planned results. Analyze the differences to determine their root causes. Determine where to apply changes that will include improvement of the process or product. When a pass through these four steps does not result in the need to improve, the scope to which PDCA is applied may be refined to plan and improve with more detail in the next iteration of the cycle, or attention needs to be placed in a different stage of the process

      I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I did not like the music. Honestly, I found a very weak artist. The beats are very easy and predictable, his voice does not reach a very high course several times. The lyrics are very sentimental with a sportier touch, then it makes no sense. Gives me the impression that he is trying to put the'' fads'' in one song and it was ridiculous and annoying to listen to.I hope he does very successfully and has great achievements, but after listening to this song I do not even want to hear the name of this singer.

      Hi Bob. Follows a quick summary of our past 2-weeks negotiations with the vendor: the full price for their standard PCs was $925 each, but we asked a bulk discount as we are going to buy 350 units. Then, they offered $900 and we say that it definitely wouldn't work: our budget only allows us to pay $600 per unit, at most! As we anticipate they would be inflexible, we sat down with them and spoke frankly saying that we were quoting with other 2 vendor and their initial price was far away from being reasonable; or they review their price accordingly, or they would be out. By the other hand, we know that they have a better service than their competitors. So, their new proposal is going with ours but we must agree with a 5-years contract of service and maintenance. We are thinking of make a deal with them. What do you think? Thanks, Jim

      In my country there is a unique kind of dance. It comes from the slaves that arrived here five hundreds years ago. They used to live in a farm and worked in the cultivation of sugar cane. They lived outside the farm, in big spaces where everybody were allowed to sleep together, men, women and children, called senzalas. To them every thing was forbidden, so they had to innovate and they created a mixture of catholic religion and candombl. In the nights, around the bonfire, they sang musics and danced something like a dance and a fight in which they used both arms and legs, mainly to kick or to jump frantically. Nowadays it's part of the culture of Brazil, a wide world famous dance called capoeira.

      In my country, if you are invited to have dinner with someone, it is always a good idea to respond, even if an RSVP is not requested. This helps with planning. It is not polite to ask if you can bring extra guests if the invitation does not make the offer. However, if the family is invited to someones home for dinner, it is okay to ask if your children are included. It is a good idea to bring a host or hostess gift like a bottle of wine or flowers. At the table, you should wait until the host sits before we do. Depends on the family a blessing will be said. Even if you do not follow the beliefs of the prayer, show respect and be silent. If the host offers a toast, lift your glass. It is not necessary to clink someone elses glass. Before eating you should observe the host or hostess and pick up your fork when he or she does.

The law against drunk drivers has been increasing the fines and the penalties, but people still keep their old habits. I believe that all these regulations have our safety as a goal, but there are some injustices. If we drink just a bit of beer, we have almost the same punishment a man who drank a bottle of whisky has. Theres no proportionality!

I want you to know that I will be there for you come what may. If there are clouds surrounding your day, you can be sure that I will do my best to make the sun shine for you. If you think there is no healing for your pain, I will be at your side to help mend your broken heart. I've been cheated, misled and hurt, therefore, I know how endless this sorrow may seem to be. Many times I thought that I would never bounce back but eventually I did. Time is a very understanding friend as it makes you grow stronger and wiser through this terrible storm. Always remember my favorite Brazilian saying: I have been through so many storms that I lost my fear of rain. Count on me!%%

Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Dear sir, I am wrinting to request you a loan because I decided to buy the house where I am living today. I am convinced that buy a house is really better than rent because the money you pay every month goes to something that is already yours. Is almost like a permanent saving account. Furthermore, you feel more confortable to make changes and repairs in your own house than in a rented one. Nowadays, I pay $800 of rent per month. May monthly expenses, as food, health and entertainment costs me $1200. As you could see in the enclosed material, my income today is $ 2500. In other words, this amount is enough to pay a mortgage and to pay off the loan. I look forward to hearing from you a response about this request. You can contact me at anytime by e-mail (xxx@fff.com) or phone (55-5555).%% Your sincerely Fernanda

I say this by myself where at home I made the cook, wash the dishes while my wife go the college at night. I consider sharing tasks is a good thing specially because this moderns days it's important for the couple have a job because one can help other.

      Technology is like magic. Sometimes it's impossible to believe that something can become  real. Then, few years later, it's there.  When I was child, I used to watch science fiction movies, like &quot;Lost On The Space&quot; and &quot;Lost  on The Time&quot;. It was like to dream with an amazing future. The most impressive thing was communication at a distance without wires between the phones. Impossible to imagine it could become real. Now, everyone has a mobile phone. It's not necessary to buy  cards or  plugs and look for a public phone. And more, if you don't want to talk, you can send  text messages or photos.  It's wonderful. Let's wait the next  magic.

Impressionists painters prefer to paint outside and they studied the efects of natural light. The highlight of this wing is the painting denomined The Road Bridge at Argenteuil, by Claude Monet (1874). It portrays feature boats on the Seine. b) The Expressionist Wing It was organized by two groups of German painters. One of them is called Blue Rider artists and are formed by the following artist: luded Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. The other group is knowed by The Bridge. Those artists tried to capture the primitive energy of animals and are experimented with bold colors. c) The Cubist Wing Inspired by Picasso and Braque in Paris, the main characteristic is the use of geometrical forms that often shows multiple viewpoints of one figure. The featured painting is Le Jour, by George Braque (1929).

Some actors used to play in lake, the coreography was one of a kind. Is difficult to explain how they used to do that, however I will try to give some details. Sometimes they swam, other times they used ships, and danced with a local music. The clothes was absolutely superb, but sometimes was exaggerated. The method to dance in the water was different from everything that I had seen., they trained every single day. Was absolutely fabulous what hey could do. The tickets was half-price for students, so I could watch the performance more than one time.

      This brochure is about a highlight of the European Collection. It starts with the Impressionist wing and part of a permanent Exhibition. The Impressionims started in ParisThe Road Bridge at Angenteuil - Claude Monet (1874). Shows the River Seine and its boats; one of the charateristics of the Impressionism is the use of complementary colors, blue-orange and green-red. In this painting, Monet applied soft small strokes of different tints and shades to create the quiet movement of the water. Moreover, Monete and other Impressionists wanted to capture the effects of light and atmosphere and convey their sensory experience. This thicker layer of underpainting as shown is the sky. This exhibit, including the Monet painting, goes from september 15th up to january 3rd. The next painting in an Expressionist Wing. This is part of a permanent collection, will close on october 1st for changes. The expressionist movement was organized by 2 groups of German painters. One was called The Bridge, and the other, The Blue Rider. We'll concentrate the last one, famous artists of the Blue Rider are Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky.%% Let's take a look at Franz Marc painting, caled The Blue Rider. Marc devoted muche of his career to painting horses and animals. This express the primitive energy of the animals. This movement ended with the outbreak of World War 1. Let's proceed to the last painting. This exhibit will open on october 1st and will run through to march 31st. It's part of a permanent collection. You can see varies pieces of the Cubism Art, initiated by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and the Frenchman, George Braque, in Paris before World War 1. In this movement, everything is reduced to geometrical forms and fragmentation is favored. It seems that several aspects of one objects are shown simultaneously. Cubism actually prepared the way for abstract art. This painting is by George Braque, in 1929, and is called Lesiure.

      okay, there was this time that my friends and I were in a party. It had been a long time since we all hung out together, so we promise to eachother that that night should be epic. But what was really epic was what happenned in the morning after. But to tell that I have to tell about the party. We were drinking a lot. Lots of beer, tequila shots, all the irresponsable stuff. We were really enjoying the show even knowing that the show after was supposed to be the main event. Just a heads up: it wasn't. But thing started in this &quot;main event&quot; show, because we got to know the drummer of the show before. That we liked. We recognized him from his performance earlier so we asked him to drink with us. Since the beggining I had the feeling that I knew him, but never got to me from where. after the party we went to my place for a few more drinks. We laughted a lot with him, and he proved to be real talented when he was singing a few of his lyrics. That's the last thing I remembered. The day after I woke up with a dog licking my face, which really scared me just until I realized that I was in my room, the I got confused.%% The guy was still in my apartment and later I found out that he was Larry Jonhson, the drummer from Dream of Butterflies (a famous band in my country).

Owners should see and analyze carefully about other people lives, I mean, sometimes the only way to survive that people have got bust because of this stores.

      My dear sister, I must tell to someone something  I witnessed that is driving me crazy. Don&quot;t tell to anybody.  Days before I was getting around with my dog Black. Suddenly I saw Peter Fakes climbing the wall of our neighbours Smith. On the other side was Laureen. I stoped and could see a pathetic scene: hugs,passionate kisses and flowers, red roses a lot for her. At that same moment I could see another man taking photos of the couple. I was paralyzed. So I realized that Mr. Smith was suspecting that his wife was cheating on him.

      There arent in Brazil high buildings as in The United States or in some countries around Asia.  The tallest building is located in So Paulo and measure 189 meters . Is the Company Business Tower A. Our largest building cannot compare with the Empire State Building which has 383 m height. Because of our large spaces, someone stated that in the history of Brazil, there hasn't been much necessity for super tall structures. I dont agree.  I think the biggest one has. But Isnt easy .The Government must formulate policies for allowing huge constructions which will influence the traffic around , they will need water supply and sewage disposal in the same proportion.  The city had been growing horizontally. Huge city like that has huge problems as well. Now they need quickly solutions for stopped the chaos. I can say it should be reduced the city size constructing big structures which concentrate offices,  residences and commerce nearby.  It would alleviate the impact of the large buildings and would help the traffic. Today is becoming more frequently construct skyscraper for offices and enterprises in So Paulo, but I feel it is not still a concern with planning for the welfare of the population.%%

Always trying to find an excuse to justify the delay in education, but it is bullshit, because other countries have encountered the same obstacles and developed. The Brazil stagnated. .Veja magazine recently published the results of educational growth in the last decade, just stayed in 58th place. Shameful. But all is not lost, the government headed by Dilma Rousseff tries to rebuild the country through education, but the problems are immeasurable. It is health, roads, criminality, corruption, finally, I think Brazil will hardly find an exit in the short term. Meanwhile, we can only hope that the next generation things change!

In June, there were rebellions all over Brazil. There's even import doctors, but health remains precarious, there are laws, but not health for the people. The poor is what suffers most. Meanwhile, deaths in traffic deaths and crimes in cities continues, despite laws that do not work. Poor Brazil.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing it's part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegadable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to by green products, but I'll pay a lot more for certain items. I'ts not easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood. I'm concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food.

      In my country, as a general rule, the education, unfortunately is not good enough if compared with anothers counties mainly the most developed such as United States, United Kingdom, Germany, etc. For example for elementary school the trend is to give tests to students less often. To be graduated in a private school, university is the best way to be more prepared to work market but in the other hand is very expensive and is not accessible to most of students.

You think that is possible? We also discuessed about clients. We need to warn them not to leave anything in the car. So we can control these thefts. And obvious, look at the work being done by the valets. Not suspicious, but select valets. It's good for the image. What do you think? I hope to hear from you. Sincerely, Vanessa.

She thinks a team is capable of winning, although there are many disagreements and power struggles within a company. She also tries to never be late. Said that punctuality makes him a worthy being of respect and admiration. And also the good humor that helps keep you focused and on good terms with all persons in the company.

However, it is commom to see a lot of people breaking this rule. It is outrageous to see motodrivers taking of theirs helmets and talking at mobile when driving. Doesnt matter about the traffic and safety concerns for them. In my opinion the rules must be more strict and expensive.

      Protests all over the country seem not to have ended yet. Due to the corruption in the national politics, people have gone to the streets to claim for a political reform since last year. Organized on social medias, protesters set the exact date, time and place for the event to occur. According to reporters, the next event will take place at the bridge that connects the main avenue to the street that leads to the airport. For this reason, the State Security Agency advises people not to take the main avenue on that day. For those who need to drive in the avenue to go home, there is a street next to the Central Bank that can be taken instead. Figures show that the number of people in the streets is increasing, resulting in more and more dangerous movements. During the last event, eight people got injuries, including police officers. One protester was interviewed last week and said that the protests won't stop until they get a reasonable answer from the president regarding the transparency of public money. Sociologists allege that, the more the government delays its statements, the more people will go to the streets.

      Everybody says that in my country there isn't natural disasters, but, this is a lie, because when the summer starts, also start the summer rains. So there is floods, falling slopes, and people die. Every year there are landslide off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. I can remember the last that ocurred in Angra dos Reis, when more than 30 people died.  In this year was in Petrpolis, when 33 people died, not to mention those that lost their homes. Is very sad to know that every year the tragedy repeats and the government do nothing to solve the problem.  Because it's impossible to avoid the rains, but, it's possible prevent to deaths.

      Is not a secret for anyone that business success relies on good leadership. Leadership skills help you to make more effective decisions, focus on your personal vision and progress towards achieving goals of your business. There is no single characteristic or quality that defines a good leader. Motivating people towards a common business goal involves a mix of styles and strategies that often take years to develop. Leaders can also come from any area of the business. As a business owner you will need strong leadership qualities, but leadership can also come from team leaders and employees. I think we have to understand the different styles of business leadership, and how to develop our skills as a leader, as well as those of our whole team. So in my opnion, we have to get the qualities of all bosses that we work together, and join with our life experiences to become freat leaders

In 2010, men still earned 10 percent more that women; yet in 1943, when women worked in industry and manufacturing during World War ll , it must have seemed so different.When Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, the role of women in society was not clearly defined.She was nicknamed &quot; the iron Lady &quot; , which surely is a sexist term, as it refers to her gender.Thatcher made decisions that shaped the UK's future..When she died in 2013, Britons were not sure how they felt.Was she a hero or not? Perhaps this was more about her politics yhan her gender.It's still a question asked about women in power in the UK today.

Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

They asked for a place where renovation wasnt necessary and also not too much paper work in order to rent it out. Having it in mind, Ive selected few places to show them. There is a cottage priced in 200.000 Euros which has been recently renovated, however it still need few repairs. As the family Blight is seeking for a place with a room for each one of their sons, this cottage may possibly not be a choice, since this cozy property has only 01 room, and can be quite small for the whole family. The other option I have to offer is a magnificent house just in front of the sea, which is one the familys request.%% The entire property is valued in 1.5 million Euros. On the other hand, this place does need some restoration, which may not be a problem for them since money is no object. In addition, the property can be used as a hotel, since it has many accommodations. It can be a good way to invest as well. As part of history, this place once belonged to wealthy families of Ithaca, which gives the place an impressive atmosphere. In my opinion, this may appeal to this family, since it has several rooms and lots of space. Just one observation - only available with the commitment to retaining or restoring the house, besides demolishment is not allowed. Greek Island has infinity of options to choose from, in regards to properties to purchase. For instance, you can find apartments with 67 sqm for a bargain of 160.000 Euros, ideal for buyers looking to invest in tourism. Even luxurious village are possible to find, such as a property located in the capital of Ithaca, Vathy. The village includes apartments with 01, 02, 03 bedrooms, roof terrace, BBQ, tv sets, many wardrobes, and so on.

      To think about my life is a routine that demand a lot of time and effort of myself. Sometimes it's very good, because I can plan ahead what ways I want to follow, but sometimes it's very stressful. I've started to work in my late adolescence, when I had fifteen. I had a traditional family, then for cultural reasons my dad &quot;invited me&quot; to work and study simultaneously. How I didn't had choice, I've agreed! During much time I regretted about this fact, but actually I've realized that was very important for my social and professional formation. Now, I'm a 29-year-old-business administrator, I have a good job, a wonderful girlfriend, some good friends and I'm studying a PhD. course in economy, which is very nice. In general I like my life, however I've few extra time to go out and enjoy the result that I just have achieved. I think that my further challenge is to balance with more confidence the time dedicated to my parents and sister, my girlfriend, my friends and to myself. In the end, I think is that more important to live and enjoy the life when we have time and health to do it, even if we don't have much money or material things.%% How Robin Willians told in Dead Poets Society film: &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;!

Now, I'm 29 years old and I'm not so young like I used to be. It's true that I'm not old, but the point is: how I have been living my life? I believe that the answer to this question is the key to understanding more about the my way of life. I mean that to be wether young or old depends on attitude about my life. In this hand, I think I'm too old. Maybe it's because I have excessive worries about academic and professional life. In the other hand, when I thought that I still have millions of things to learn, I can see how I'm young. Nowadays I'm trying to balance social, professional and academic live.  Thus.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly grenn products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is trully green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Here in Brazil, if you was invited to a party in a friends house, the first step to do is confirm your presence. Doesnt matter if you go or not, is very important to give a return for the host. Probably the host will make the food according to the number of guests. The second important behavior to follow is always give a gift for the host. If will be a Birthday party, the gift may be given just for the birthday boy.  For a formal party, you must pay attention in your vestiment. Always according to the situation. If you dont have a formal invitation for email or letter, saying the correctly vestiment , dont be shy and take a phone call asking about it. In the dinner time, wait until the owners of the house starts, dont be hasty. If there were waiters, no problems with the food and drinks, you are free to serve yourself. Alcohol drinks are very dangerous, therefore, make sure that you will drink enough to have fun and never disturb other guests. Dont forget: if you drink, dont drive back to home. Be happy and enjoy!

      I would like to talk about the directors of my company. I have been noticing that all of them have similar traits. I think that the possible similarities exist due the fact that they have success in their job. All of them reached the high positions in the company. The main point to have success is to be passionate for what you do. Then, you need to turn this academic success into business success. Also, you must be proactive, persistent, innovative, creativity and never gives up. All of this you can easy find in all directors. They can pass this motivation for the managers and others employees. Although they have a tough professional career, the most of them can be succeed in other areas. To know how to divide the professional life for the social life is a big step to get succeed with the family, with the friends, with your health and with your hobbies. If you focused only in one objective, probably will lose the others. To finish, there are many ways to measure and is difficult to pinpoint what defines success.

      I really know the importance of office politics, of course it is something that I would like to ignore but if it exists you need to understand it and play the game, obviously, as fair as possible. In my company, like others, every employee desires to be a succesful career, and depending on your goals/objectives you need to assimilate how to be part of the team and take advantage of your circle of influence. For instance, I normally try to listen to someone's opinion and respect their ideas because I will need support from them at some point. Therefore, the best way is to be seen as a kind proactive professional, in return you will be supported by your colleagues when you need. Is just the way it is. By contrast, if you are an envious person who is always trying to play dirty games at work, you will be stabbed in the back when you least expect it. What goes around, comes back around. Office politics is a reality and you need to develop skills about it whether you want to succeed, wherever company you are.

There was another comedian who had a play that was almost a dream. His name was Barnabas. Barnabas had a special way of telling a story. He knew to engage the audience. The audience was varied from intellectuals to ordinary people and was always full of children too.

      I live in Brazil and here we have the same problem with rating system. It's complex and there are a lot of violence on TV. Isn't  specific programs with murders, but there many others with polices and negative energy. In my opinion, the brazilian Tv needs a huge transformation, we have had a long time the same programs, with same apresenter and he isn't good enough. I hate his voice and dialogue with the guests, because his talk a lot. The soap opera in Brazil was better than now. Sometimes I think they just change the actress and actor because the plot is the same all time. Normally I don't watch TV, I prefer watch movies and American series because I practice my english together.

      In my opinion green business is one of the most important things in the world. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business shoul consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about. We have to pay attention in them!%%

Usually I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals.

Because the teachers medical insurance doesnt offer many doctors and health cares. I have not to pay rent. I have my own house. My main expenses are: food, transportation, leisure of weekends, private medical insurance, car insurance, pet expenses (I have one cat and one dog and sometimes they get sick), many taxes for government, etc. The other problem is with transportation: every 2 months I fuel my car with gasoline or alcohol. However, both have prices up right now. I try to save money, Im thrifty! I hope things get better and the cost of living starts to go down Regards!

      Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to open a mortgage in order to purchase the house I am currently renting. I believe that it will be cheaper for me to buy than to rent in the long run. Not only will I also benefit from the property building equity, but I would also benefit from the stability of owning my own home and freedom to make changes when needed. Just completing the reasons for buying a house, I will eventually be free of monthly payments  after the discharge of mortgage. Is like a permanent saving account.

      These is a tough subject and divisive issue. But it is something that's worth to discuss a little bit. Nowadays is too comon to see some companies, industries, factories, etc trying to improve their image through a CSR (corporate social responsability) action. It doesnt the matter what they really do to make business, everybody wants to be nice in the photo. Sometimes it makes me stop, thing and realize what are their main purposes with these kind of actions. And I do that because it is hard to see who is doing that with a second intention or really cares and has as an objetive to repay what we have done for them. Most of them can be even forced by government to take part of some programs that are in favor of a local community for example.

      Green business is important to me and to citizens. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. There are many non-organic products contain pesticides that are not healthy . Many people tend to get cancer virtues of contaminated non-organic foods . Of course, you have a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.%% Many companies are using green advertising companies to increase sales , however , are not doing anything to preserve nature and the health of consumers .

Always very direct and sometimes a little bit rude with her staff.

It's very common now a days to see a couple which both of then work in a company and sometimes the woman do receive a better salary than the man. I think thats because women are more flexible and are able to do a lot of things at the same time. But if the women and the men are working, who will raise their children? I guess everything has it negative side. What we really need to do is always try to mensure the benefits and the losses and then goes with your belief.

      Laws made by legislators always have double meaning. They've never voted for a rule that is in favor of the population, politicians defend their own interest. Things like gun control, tobbaco and drug legislation, tend to attack the population freedom, since that you must be responsible for your own health. Todays modern or postmodern governments are approving laws that take people's freedom away, justifying the government to use force against the society and don't solve the real problem: the comunity's health. Everyone should take care of yourselves, and stop waiting for a solution that come from bureaucrats. They have only one interest: get elected on the next poll.

      My home town Uberlndia, has about six hundred thousands inhabitants and is getting bigger and bigger every day. As the city grows, the number of buildings is also increasing to meet the needs of people for more space and structure. Founded in the 19th-century the architecture is prety simple. The are not to many buildings left from this period. Most part of the constructions has less than fifty years old and I would consider this kind of architecture as a modern style. The Champ's build is one that catches my attention. Build in 1978 is a 22 floor with big green windows. Is located in the city center was the tallest &quot;skyscraper&quot; for many year. Today, this title is held by the Shopping Mall Businesses Center with thirty floors. Overall, however, I am pretty sure that you will enjoy visit Uberlndia.

The Expressionist Wing   Part of our permanent collection, this movement was organized by two groups of German painters: The Bridge and The Blue Riders  Blue Rider artists included Franz Marc, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky At the The Blue Rider, by Franz Marc we see he liked painting animals, like horses, experimented with bold colors expressing the primitive energy of animals. His compositions were radical. This movement ended due to the World war I.Open on August 12th and close on October 1st.    The Cubist Wing  It is also part of our permanent collection and expected from visitors from all over the world.

      Success is a goal that the most people want to reach, I think. Even whether they doesn't know, they want to be successful in some aspect of their lives. But what makes someone successful or unsuccessful? There''s not a mathematical method. It's a mix of several qualities and abilities that can vary in number and grade. I can mention persistence, perseverance, creativity, a future vision and a sense of innovation, or maybe just a memory. Well defined goals, or in certain cases just an idea. As I said, it's not precise, it's not scientific. Some people believe in divine inspiration, the God's finger action. Others can think in predestination, a fortuity, a destiny's accident. Doesn't exists just one way, or the right and wrong. The absence of a formula may be the key. Perhaps the success is defined when we enter and accept the game. The courage to face the journey is most important, maybe it is what leads us to the success, not the expected results. When we do it with ethic and respect, the victory is certainly complete.

      I think that it is important to schedule some time to work effectively in the project or task. Actually, specially in the big companies, a lot of time is lost to make meetings and discuss about several things. Usually are long meeting and it involve a lot of employees. I know, it is important align the things, but with moderation in my opinion. Is common listening the employees to make claims about the long meetings. It's boring. Nowadays there are a lot of systems that can help the companies to be more efficient. It is important to use it. Some strategies also are very helpful, for example, use the competitive intelligence to improve the results, the knowledge management to organize the information, the TI team. Everyone have much to contribute. So, if the company hope to have success nowadays, should focus in this new technologies.

      I think that in almost all offices there are some kind of politics and it is important to follow it if you desire to get a promotion in the future. Usually are promoted the employees that respect the company rules and has a good relationship with the coworkers. Is necessary more than make a good job.  Because of this some times younger employees get a promotion, instead of a more experient colleague.  Day by day it is more important to know how get a good relationship in the organizations, in all levels of company. In general, optimistic and friendly person has more oportunities in the corporative world. So, if you want to be a successful professional, be friendly with others and offers help always that it is possible, besides be updated with the new technologies.

      Best Books Company has been losing international sales since 2005, and those seem to be steady since early 2007. Although, the company. has also experienced a sharp increase in domestic sales since late 2006, but this tendency has changed in the second semester of 2007. The graph shows that the company should have a strategy to change the overall stagnation scenario and try to recover, specially its international sales, but must not forget to identify what led to the dropping in domestic sales, since this is a more recent effect.

Other characters are Fantine, Cosette, Marius, Thnardier (including ponine and Gavroche) and Inspector Javert. In my opnion is the best movie of all time.

      In Brazil we have some etiquette rules, for certain occasions. For example, when you go to a meeting in your job, you have to wear more formal clothes and you have to speak without uttering slangs. You also should pay attention when other person is speaking, and should respect your opinion, even if you don't agree with it. Sometimes, if you want to let the atmosphere of the meeting more enjoyable, is very nice to tell funny stories, since it does not offend anyone. Is very impolite if you yawn and if you stare at the clock all the time. These bahaviors are unacceptable.

      Since February 1998, the Federal law that regulates the punishments for crimes against nature has a strange aggravating: the penalty increases to crimes that occur on &quot;Sundays or holidays&quot;. Is the old Brazilian way: with less supervision in these periods, the Government increased the penalty to discourage ecological assaults on the patrol's days off. Since the lack of oversight is a very serious problem for compliance of the laws in Brazil, I don't believe that such aggravating actually prevents someone committing an environmental crime. In Brazil, we have some of the best laws to protect nature but the reality is completely different from the paper. And it's useless to have the best laws when they aren't being applied. But I hope that the future generations will have a better conscience and they will respect the nature, so all these many rigid laws won't be necessary to guarantee a better place for everyone to live because everyone will do their part.

It's not necessary to bring a gift when you are invited to a dinner but when you do so, it shows that you are very thoughtful. You should always wait until the host begin eating. Is considered unpolite when you put your elbows on the table while you are eating or to speak with your mouth full. You should put the napking over your lap during the dinner, and leave it over the chair if you need to get up. After the dinner you should put the napking on the table.  Nowadays, it's okay to the couple split the bill but some men still prefer to pay it all. It's always very welcome when someone calls to thank or send a note on the day, It shows great politeness and consideration.

Our history shows that Brazilian society change for economic reason (crisis normally), but the effect of we have a female President of the country can accelerate this tendency is under analysis.

      During the Brazilian slave period (started in the 16th Century) had emerged a musical performing art called &quot;Samba&quot;. The Samba is composed by a mix of African tribal songs and rituals, and Portuguese songs and dancing. At the initial period, Samba was only performed by slaves during their parties (when and if allowed by their &quot;owners&quot;). Using powerfull colors and talking about their uses and habits, concerns and their homesickness, the slaves had created a singular show time. The musical instruments used were tambors (made with animals skin and wood) as used in their hometown (Africa). Only in the beginning of the 20th Century the Samba had reached the cities and started to be part of the &quot;Carnival&quot; (The most popular party in the world). After the Samba had been accepted by the large part of the population, several singers started to create a lot of composition for the &quot;Brazilian music&quot;. Nowadays the Samba is part of our lifestyle and the most popular music in Brazil.

      I remember the first time that I put my hands on a smartphone. I had an old-fashioned mobile and it really was shocking for me. Seems that the whole future were fitting on the palm of my hand. It was really amazing! Entering the social networks and shopping online became very usual. It made me rethink about the real meaning of the things. Virtual friendship could be superficial and senseless. However, things we never thought doing virtually, like surfing the web or paying bills could finally be made. Now, we cannot live without texting and video callings. We are living the future!

      I think technology has much more good than bad points. I can relate some of the advantages of technology in my day by day life: access the GPS while I'm driving to somewhere I don't exactly where it is, it's really helpfull! One of the GPS that I have, shows me even the best way, considering the traffic jam. Using mobile apps to send messages are realy practical. Furthermore, it's possible to save money, since you don't need to pay for it. Skype is another example of a great app. When my husband is travelling abroad, we can see each other by video, and talk without spending anything! Nowadays our mobile phones are like little computers, so we find the information easily and we have much more benefits. The only thing that we need to be aware is that sometimes we leave in the background the real life, to live in the virtual world, for example spending so much time in social medias.

His voice is edgy and rough. The mood of song has a little change on the end. First it's edgy, then it's kind of happy and the tune becomes pretty catchy. The beat is almost the same during the most part of song, then, there isn't much of beat. When I listened for the first time, it makes me feel angry, with headache. But after, it makes me feel relaxed. Is strange, but I don't recommend this music, because the melody could be better.

I don't worry about prices, my caution is about the utility of the clothing! I prefer cotton and knitted fabric. My favorite colors are: white, light-yellowish green and light blue. I prefer light colors than dark tonalities. I like to wear T-shirts and jeans. If the occasion requires a formal outfit, I'd rather wear long sleeved shirt with trousers instead of suit with tie.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green , then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, bit I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I ear, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food.

      I listened a new Josh Woodward song called &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and I'll tell to you my impressions about this song, ok? Actually, I like rock n'roll music, with electric guitars, bass, fast beats on the drums and a rough voice, but, I'd really liked this song. &quot;Home Improvement&quot; remind me folk music like Bob Dylan. Josh's voice is the voice a baritone, reaching the medium notes very well. This is so confortable to listen, sounds good, for sure! The phrases of acoustic guitar in the solo moment sounds pretty good, with beautiful and simple melodies. Theres no changes on the rhythm music, sounds linear, but It's not a bad thing for me, cause, I like linear songs sometimes. I recommend.

      Hi, Mr. Porro. How are you? I have some positive news for you, but I need to tell you about negative news too. In this week, on Wednesday, we had our seasonal meeting to discuss our business with our partners. Willian, the brand manager, told us about the sales situation and how about we can work with this problem, because the sales are decreasing quickly. He showed to us some strategies to increase sales. I think that we have good plans and a good team. Well, after that, Willian gave us a summary about the last year sales to compare and to study our new business direction. Sounds good to me. I'm feeling fewer worried now. That's it! Best, Chris

      In Brazil, we have laws for everything, I mean, there is more laws that people do not know just 1% of it. The other issue is that, people are corrupted, not everyone, not when a bunch of guy are together, but alone, I will say 80% are corrupted. It goes from police on street to fiscal auditors for companies. Is ashamed to say that, but I think majority of population admit that. They only law that works, that everyone can confirm is when a couple split and they have a child or more, father has to pay monthly fee to the mother until they complete 18 years old, maximum of 30% of fathers salary. If he does not pay, he goes to jail right way. Simple and fast, no excuse. In my point of view, all the laws supposed to be follow like that. Personally I think many laws confuse more than explain, but it must be follow. The point is that everyone allowed yourself to not follow it in very simple things, like passing a traffic light when it is RED during the night, running at a higher speed than allowed. Small things, but it is not right.

      Is gender social equality still a dream? As in a worldwide sense, in Brazil there are still some differences between men and women in society. For example, in average, men have higher salaries than women. A pattern presents in all social classes that you want to consider. Many Brazilian people believe these inequalities would decrease after our first woman president, elected in 2010. However, I prefer to have caution on this kind of statement. For example, other similar cases in the world, like that in the UK with Margaret Thatcher as the prime minister in 1979, dont give me much hope on this regard, and show us that gender differences is a much more complex phenomena than we thought to be in the past.

The problem is, all the time the violent programs and movies with sex scenes are shown. The news always exhibit people being murdered. Violence here raise the audience on TV. Nowadays the parents can't stay at home all time to take care of your kids, the life is busy, so you have to spend money putting them in daycare or leaving with the grandparents. One solution is, these type of programs to be displayed only at night when the parents arrive.

      One of important thing to know before to travel to any country in the world is about the laws. Of course most of people dont care about it, but its a way to get in trouble for nothing, or better, because you didnt follow or obey the laws. In Brazil is possible to buy and consume tobacco and alcohol by people older than 18. If someone try to sell or offer to teenager ( less than 18) you probably get in jail. Lets talk about other drugs like : marijuana, cocaine, exctasy are illegal. If someone is get with small portion (just for personal use) , its is qualified as minor demeanor, in this case, is possible to pay a fine and walk out. In case the police gets th people carrying a amount  of drugs, there is no fine, the people go straight to prison, qualified as trafficant. This is law is applicable for entire country, there is no free zones, there is no second chance. I think this law is correct, I mean, Im favor on that.

In the past, women were used to stay at home with their children. They didn''t work out and almost exclusively took care of the family. Now a days is quite diferent. We have women in all professions, like doctors, layers, politics, high administratives charges etc. And more, the majority of then don''t let their home obligation.

Is not fair the factories, corporate and any kind of commercial companies use the material from the nature, such as weather row materials, minerals, wood, metal, food, etc and after all process to manufacture their goods they discharge their waste, pollute the air and water destroying the environment and earning money. The companies are destroying the environment, they just think about the profit and don''t care to the world condition. That is why Corporate Social Responsibility must be made for all kind of company, they need take care of the earth not just use their natural material. Sustainability is essential for the earth, if the companies don''t think about their responsibilities with the environment and the population in some year the earth will be uninhabitable. Fortunately the government is been more rigid with some questions; companies should follow several laws that care about the environment and for better working conditions for the employees.

      Well, in general I'm more optimistic than pessimistic. Why I said this? Because we could see how fast the tecnology grew in last 20 years. In several business environment we can see such the biggest companies using the tecnology as the littles ones. Is means that the cost of technology is becoming cheaper. But, in the other hand and unfortunatly, it's possible to see the war between companies for more and more high profits. But thinking better I'm really believe that we will live a age that CEOs, employees, community, all stakeholder will have the new mindset changed to takecare at the same time about the profits, the community and the planet.

Tonight I make a toast for Vico as a demonstration of my sincere feelings towards this amazing guy. First, Id like to thank the groom's parents for this memorable event. I was to move to London with my wife when we decided to come to Dublin because Vico was living here. He helped us to find a place and he was there at the airport to welcome us and to bring us to where we would live. In the first night he brought us to a party of his new friends. At some point he was very drunk and we very tired. We said that we wanted to go home and asked what direction it was, as we were very newbie about the place. He gave us the direction and we went straight forward to it. Minutes later he regret about leaving us alone and ran on our track to help us to find our place. It was that way he happened to meet Karol. He met her crossing the road at 3 am, just by chance and, suddenly, they fell in love.%% Vico is a great guy and a very singular one. Love stories for him wouldn't be so traditional. The funniest thing is that Vico had never been in a serious relationship and here he is today: getting married to a great and beautiful woman who we know he is in love. I wish all the best for them both and that the love stands always within their lives. Cheers!

      Hi Angela, I just listen to the song 'Home Improvement', by that artist you told me, Josh Woodward. In my opinion this song is all right. Have a good and a little happy melody, like folk,  and very addictive beat. The lyrics in other way are very political and tell us a sad story, very sentimental. This guy, Josh, have a rough and edgy voice, but he does't have much of a range. I think that is a good song to your radio program. Is very interesting. The way he made it is great, using sadness and happiness. I recommend this music. I hope I had help you. See you, Mslova

      I am a fifth son of a six brothers' family. When I was a little boy, we had just a single television for all the family. Every day after the dinner, we reunited ourselves around the TV to watch the journal and be aware of the news. This is pretty much what happened during all the 80's. In the 90's things started to change, specially in the late-90's. With the advent of the internet, people now are able to be aware of the news every time they want. First, in their computers, and now in their mobile devices. Furthermore, since every person can be content producer, the number of media vehicles growth exponentially, thanks to the internet. Now we have a totally new way of spreading a news: through the social networks every important information can be shared in a blink of an eye, even faster than the formal vehicles. Now we are living a truly revolution. What can we say about the future? Is the changes continue to happen at such velocity, it's impossible for us now to forecast what could come in the next twenty years.

But, the difference of salary is still around 13 percent in some states and it seems that is decreasing due to salary increasing when women are hired is better than when men start to work in a new company. Wen we are talking about behavior inside the house we can see that women are almost the same in the past taking care your children and homework even this women go out to work.

One big advantage is that the phone has a built-in camera. I can take a picture and send it to my family. Sometimes it can be very overwhelming.I'm completely fascinated by it. The battery is the only problem with it. It just doesn't last very long.

      I believe that the environmental cause is very noble. Nowadays it's almost impossible to live without think about the consequences that our acts imply to the nature. Simple acts like eat, drink, make shopping and physical needs, for example, are directly linked to the way we lead with environment. I think that I have so much to do about it as recycle to begin, but it is like a habit that we need to construct and it doesn't happen overnight. I think that all society need to be more advertised about this counsciousness, because we need big efforts to overcome problems like pollution and the waste of natural resources. I think that green habits are going to be a big positive trend in the future because the idea of a better place to live has already been planted in our minds and I'm sure that future generations are going to believe each time more that it's necessary to change our world through our acts.

      In my opinion, green business is when a company take care of their impact or a product impact in the environment. Is like a company who sells smartphones switching from plastic (which is bad for the environment) to aluminium (that could be recycled over and over again). For the companies, green business is a good publicity for they, help them to find new consumers and help the world. In my company, we always look for a different way to reduce our impact at the world without damaging our profits. In 2013, we often used plastic and foam in our packages, but since a consumer feedback, we noticed that our current packages were not a environment friendly, so we search for new kinds of packages which do not take more than ten millions years to decompose. So that is it, green business is companies taking care of their product's impact in the environment.

      Economy always has been an important issue in every corner of the world. In a world whose population increases fast and continuously, it is natural that there is a concern about a business trade. Words such as; trade balance, raw products, made products , embargo and  high tariffs are more and more common, even to the people who are not interested in economics matters.  Some countries argue that the only way they can safeguard domestic industries and the livelihood of their citizens is to impose tariffs on imported goods and services. Some also argue that they don't want to rely on foreign countries for food. Here in South America we have the following acronym MERCOSUL  translated into English stands for the Common Market of the South. Is an agreement between countries in South America, which aims to create greater integration of their economies and thereby improve the lives of its inhabitants. Through this agreement, countries can do business to increase trade between them. Of course there are some advantages and disadvantages like any other business relation, however  is better to learn how to deal with profits and losses than live between a trade war.

      I live in Brazil, a very rich country in popular performing arts. It's a huge country made by the influence of many different cultures of the entire World. The most known performing art is the Carnival. It's a street performing with music, unique costumes, dancers. And it's a competition where the teams compete for best song, best costumes, best singers and dancers. It's very pretty to see because people are always very happy in participating, and that's why I like it! Here, in Brazil, we have a huge social gap, with few riches and a lot poor. The Carnival is the unique time when there is no poverty or wealth, we are just brazilians sharing the same avenue, the same party with no differences between ourselves. Is the time where everyone is a king or a queen. It's very beautiful thing to see.

      In Brazil there is a new law in some states that prohibits to drive if the person ingested alcoholic beverage. Depends on the body's alcoholic strength, one can go to jail or just pay the fine. Otherwise I think it's a right law, I know it's very complicate to follow it. People are very used to go out with friends or have a dinner in some restaurant and have a glass of wine or some beers. And there is a fact that cabs here in my city are too expensive. The public opinion is very divided about this law. It's true that we have a lot of accidents that happens because of a drunk driver, but maybe the level tolerance could be a little more higher, I mean, if I have just a glass of wine I think I'm perfectly able to drive! The Constitution in Brazil is very old and the legal system doesn't work well. That's a lot of innocents in jail and a lot of bandits free and even ruling the country. So, in my point of view, a new law like this can ends with someone's life for just having a glass of wine at dinner.%%

Nowadays people prefer to forget the past and build a new life. It's bad for themselves because everybody needs understand the past for make a good future.

      I live in the north of Brazil in a small city called Boa Vista. Boa Vista is located on the right bank of Branco river. The architecture is simple. We have a lot of houses and a fewer buildings (four high buldings). I think that our architecture is poor because we are a poor state in Brazil, maybe the poorest state in Brazil, but for some time now Boa Vista is developing quickly and every day we can see new constructions. I think that we don't suffer influence from any arcchitectural style. As I said our architecture was very simple and now it is becoming comteporary. Sounds weird, but we don't suffer influence from the forest or from indigenous, even though we are located in the Amazon. The forest and the Indians influence our culture and traditions, but not our architecture. I recommend some buildings and locations as a must-see event or touristic places such as Orla, Branco's river beaches, Catedral or Matriz Church.

      CSR is a reality in my country. Almost all of big companies have a CSR program. Today the concern for environment is increasing on business community. I have my own opinion about that.

The most of these companies do a PR stunt instead charity or something like that. I am not a big fan of animals, I prefer people. That's why I believe in companies concerned about people disadvatanged. Today the job of taking care of society must be splitted between government and companies which earn a big turnover in my country.

      In Brazil, the public education isn't good.  We don't have good publics elementary and high school. To get the University, easily, you need to study in private schools that are tooo much expensive. Is unusal people figure out what they want to do when they are young. So, you can see part of a growing older population going to school to make decisions about their lives. I support this attitude, but would be better if they've decided about their carrer before. On the other hand, Brazil is a country with a population is getting older and it is important that people can choose what to do in old age.

      Is very hard to choose one specific law to talk about. At first I thought about traffic laws that are not severe enough to make people think twice before they drink and drive, but this is not the major problem in my country. Please, don't get me wrong, I know this is a terrible thing and there are many victims each year and I really hope for a change in our traffic laws to punish this unbelievable behavior. In my point of view, the worst thing about the laws is that they are totally unfair. It's common to hear that the law is blind, but it's not true. In Brazil, powerful people - politicians - hardly ever go to the jail because they have a lot of money to pay the best lawyers, buy witnesses and judges and after years of judgment they are free because the law defines a maximum time limit to finish the judgment. That is the main reason for our social inequality.

      Recently I have seen a play which is called 'Vale Tudo'. 'Vale Tudo' is a musical about Tim Maia, one of the biggest singers that Brazil has already had. I've grown up to listen to his musics under the influence of my Dad that grown up listening to as well. Comes up a three-hour musical with an intermission of 15 minutes, showing all time how was a little Tim Maia's life since his childhood, becoming a renowned singer until his death. I admit that I felt I was in a Broadway show, because there are many theaters in Brazil, but musical is not quite common. That play is unique! It's not because I'm a big fan of Tim Maia, but the artists and director are really professionals, the lights, the choreography it's a masterpiece. The price of tickets is a bit expensive, but it was well worth the money, I think all the audience has thought the same.

      In general, people in Brazil are very casual. It doesn't mean impoliteness, they will just treat an unknown as a friend. Is very common to invite someone to your house in the first time you met, probably to a dinner. Refuse these kind of invitation could be impolite, depending on the host. If you go do a restaurant, you may offer yourself to pay the bill for your guest. Another tip for restaurants is that in Brazil don't exist tipping, those are included in the employee's salary. In a business meeting etiquette rules are more rigid. Although Brazilians normally greet with hugs or kisses, in a business meeting they probably will greet with a handshake.

      I never gave importance to technology. Laptops and smartphones were toys for rich people play. One day, my phone broke and I had to buy another one. Nowadays it's hard to find a simple phone. So, I bought a smartphone. At first, I used it only to make calls, but my friends encouraged me to explore this tool. It's really addictive. You can keep in touch by text, email with your family, access the internet, take pictures, play games and also use it as a phone. I've became dependent on it. Despite being a great tool to make our days easier, the downside is the overconfidence that we have on it. If the battery dies or it's stolen, we don't know, not even, any number phone to call for.

      I can not tell about etiquette in my country because I came from an poor family and we don't know a lot of stuffs about etiquette. But, we know that the people can not speak with full mouth and don't receive call with their cell phones at the table. In my country is not necessary take a little gift when the people is invited to dinner. Is not necessary, too, answer to thank after a dinner. I don''t know about the use of cutlery. I don't know if the fork is used in the right hand or not. Also, if the bigger plate is use to soup, bread or meal. I should like to learn about etiquette, although I think never would it because I never go to dinner in rich families' house. I think that is beautiful when a family is dining at the table. Parents and children in a solemn moment. My family dinner watching TV. There is not etiquette, but there is good manners and, too, respect between us.

      Dear Cora! It's been a long time since I write you and I wonder if you're right. I would also like to tell you that I'm still trying to learn English. As you know I love to travel not only here at home but whenever possible the outside too. And it is precisely at this point that is my great frustration. I can not communicate in English despite already be studying for a long time. I think learning other languages ??is a skill like music, painting, poetry, etc.. And I have no skill. I believe this is the reason I have so much trouble to learn. The schools in which I spent forever asking for me to write much in English, but I would like to learn first talking and eventually I would worry about writing. Because when I travel I need to communicate talking and not writing. Of course I think it's important to know to write, but at the moment is not what I need. Thank you for your friendship, Clovis

      In my country, during the 1950s, women were supposed to be housewife and raise the children while men went out to make money, especially in small cities. In early 1960s, during military regime, a thousand of students went to streets to protest against the Government, including women. They learned to fight for their rights and to claim a better position in society. Since then, women started to work while being housewife. Women are still a minority in Brazilian companies, but they are getting more and more positions, including executives and CEO jobs. Yet women are not well paid as men, they women work hard for what they believe its right: to get an important position in society. This said, social scientists have been observing a slow but constant decrease in birth rates in Brazil. Sounds as we'll soon have deal with a very delicate question in a few years.

      I live in Brazil, the most part of people are polite and tolerant with tourists. The Brazilian culture is very different of the others places on the World. Here it is normal hug, kisses on the faces soon you meet someone. People always invited the strangers for their houses. I always advised my friends that came of other countries about the brazilians typical costumes, like offering a drink called caipirinha or the music called samba that is usually loudly and made a lot of noise. I cant forget the party knows as the carnival, hundreds of men playing drums while women dancing. It is the best part of the year, always happens in February, thousands of tourists come to Brazil, enjoyed the party. Is always very funny  to see their trying to dance.

There are just a few changes. Theres not much of a change in mood, too. It's kind of happy. The singer, Josh Woodward, doesn't have much of a range, but his voice is calm and pleasant. You can dance to Home Improvement, because it has a beat. As I said, Home Improvement isnt a very original song, but you should listen to it. Let me know your opinion.  Regards. Andr

      In Brazil, there are laws to limit how many hours employees can work in a week. The limit is approximately forty hours. Its possible to exceed this limit, reaching up to fifty hours, but there are two conditions. One is that the daily workload cant exceed ten hours. The other is that these extra hours are more expensive (cost of normal time + 50%). Im a government employee and theres another law for my career. In my case, the limit is the same, but my overtime is not paid. I can just compensate those hours on another day. I know these limits may sound a little strange to other cultures, but they are required to prevent the exploitation of workers.

But soon I realized that everything was based on a set of interests and that if I would want of the to highlight professionally would not be enough just be prepared and know work well, but to grow professionally in a company is necessary to have a good relationship with everyone and also search for highlight socially among the rest. We can't be so imperious and we have that show some humility. Look for know the people in your circle of influence. Don't trust in all collegues of the work, some people make dirty game in behind your back. Is important be  very careful not to make enemies and try be friend of the boss because he can be your biggest advocate. Remember that politics office isn't necessarily a war. You can get all the you want without be deceptive, without practicing corruption. Nothing best of that grow as an employee by their ability, their talents and efforts. Andra Guimares

      I just saw 'Star Wars.' What an amazing movie! 'Star Wars' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Star Wars' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!

      Thinking about how different life was 25 years ago, I am tempted to believe that in the next 25 years our life will continue to change dramatically. First of all, some recent political events (including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement and Indignados), the current trends of big data analysis by the government and by corporations and the strengthening of network, relational and communitarian aspects in social life, suggest that politics is the next field to be extremely affected in the future, due, in part, to technology. People are rejecting traditional representative democracy firmly and movements like &quot;slow democracy&quot; and &quot;Living Room Conversations&quot; are getting stronger and stronger. Political scientists already believe that internet was (and still is) the key for this shift to &quot;participative politics&quot;. 3D printing is likely to get more accessible and our capability of sharing and reproducing content will be heavily potentialized. Then, intelectual property is bound to become more and more liquid than it already is. DIY and &quot;participation&quot; ? be it on politics or in products and objects ? is, therefore, an unstoppable tendency.

Without any knowledge of English, I wouldn't learn how to program.

I started learning English when I was 16, not always on traditional ways, and it has been a long journey. My English skills have been developed to suit my needs. So, when I was learning programs development I needed to read a lot and my reading skills have increased as much as I've learned. Then I needed to understand people talking on tutorials on the Internet. And as it had a lot of technical language was easier to me to understand tutorials than, for example, listen american music or watching movies. Now I want to study in a Canadian University and my efforts are all to understanding people in usual situations and my near future plan is to develop my fluency.%%

      I think that green business is important to the world. If a business is green, it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. I believe that a business should consider using renewable energy, such as wind power or hydropower, or an office with a green roof to be truly green. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I pay a lot more for green products and Id go out of my way to by them. Its not always easy to find green products in my neighborhood, but I sacrifice some things to buy truly green products. Therefore, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. Of course, you have to take a company at its words that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

While this might be true, its also true customers choose Century because its simply the most reliable and the best watchmaker on the market. Thats the reason why Century became the top watchmaker worldwide. Considering Centurys trend of working with succeed people. We had the idea of inviting the 11 times elected the best golf player in the world to make a campaign. We decided, that the quality to the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would be simple and crystal-clear, but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message; a message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad. Golf and Century. The perfect team. Its a simple message that everyone can understand. I look forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Marcos

      Two years ago, there was a big storm that results in a terrible landslide in a city near Rio de Janeiro called Petropolis. Petropolis is a small city in a mountain region of Rio de Janeiro State. The storm lasted three days without stopping. Almost one thousand people were killed during the storm by the landslide. Furthermore, five thousand people lost their houses and had to spend many months sleeping at public buildings or stadiums. That was the worst natural tragedy in the last fifty years in Brazil. Thousands people donated hundreds of thousands kilos of food, a lot of water and hundreds of first aid kits. Until now, the life in Petropolis has not returned to normal. Many people have left the city and have moved to cities far from the mountain region. Unfortunately, hundreds houses have not been rebuilt until now. However, we hope that this tragedy never happens again and the public authorities take the necessary providences to avoid damages and injuries like these for the people in the same circumstances in the future.

Another thing that really affected positively my reading life was a reading application developed by Amazon called Kindle. Before downloading it, I had been reading paper books. Sometimes it was unconfortable to carry my book on bus, subway or wherever I might be. The huge advantage of that, is that I carry my own library on a small, slight smartphone. It is fantastic ! As a matter of fact, to join a social net, as Facebook, bring some implications, if we use it without wisdom it can bring us unexpected problems. One simple word misplaced can spread gossip in few seconds, resulting in broken relationships. Altogether, it changed our liver for better.

      I have listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward and I really liked the melody and arrangement. It''s a kind of folk music with lots of beat and quick lyrics. Josh's voice is rough and edgy reaching the right notes on a happy mood. You can invite your friends to dance it on a party although I think that the lyrics are political but not offensive. There are a little bit of romantism and sadness making it interesting and with to much sentimental mood. Sometimes the rhythm remember a country music without the redneck accent. I recommend this music when you want to have fun with your friends.

      This is a trick question, but I think the performing art that I like a lot is the Frevo. Frevo is a dance that happens every year in Pernanbuco carnival ( a state northeast Brazil). Every state in Brazil has their own carnival, in Pernambunco the Frevo is the traditional one, like in Rio we have the &quot;Desfile das escolas de samba&quot; Something like &quot;Samba Schools Parade&quot; This dance  is a dance with quickly movements, greatly influenced by Capoeira (martial art originated in Brazil, created by slaves in a long time ago). I like Frevo because of the animation you feel when watching it happens. Is something really interesting, everytime I watch some Frevo performance I feel like I were jump from the chair and begin to dance with them.A funny thing about frevo is that all dancers use a tiny Umbrella with them. This one is so important that Unesco already announced Frevo like a Immaterial Patrimony from Humanity.

      In Brazil, like in many other countries, women always complain about gender differences, mostly about wage differences. According with recently research women usually earn 10-20% less than men. But, with if they are civil servants these differences don't exist. The opportunities are the same and it doesn't matter with you are a man or a woman. The most important thing is your capability to do the work. In a competitive world what we see today is an advance in the women force. They are taking importante and different places. Is not rare you see women as pilots, managers, in armed forces. On the other hand, nowadays, you can see men in functions occupied for women before. For instances: they are chefes, take care of home, take care of children. I believe that in few years the game is going to change, and the men will complain about space and opportunities.

Maximize the simple and good things you have and take place in your life. Laugh a lot, sing, dance, make great travels or little trips if you like it, work out and eat healthy foods to achieve good health to get older the best than you can, greet everyone, and call by name if you know his name (it's very important; I believe that hear his name is a symphony to the ear of a person).

      In my opinion, successful persons can be described in three main points, as follows: a) Persistence. The person who wants to achieve success must be persistent. If you have an idea or a dream it can only become reality if the person persists, no matter the problems it will be necessary to face. But at the same time you also need to be intelligent. It's not worth spend your time and energy on a bad idea or proccess. b) Lead. It's very hard to make the things alone. Sometimes it's just impossible. You may also need a team to transform your idea in something real. With that in mind, if you don't have a leadership knowledge, you can easily fail. c) Persuasion. Once you have achieved the two points above, this third one won't be so difficult. Persuasion power is very important and also very different from authoritarianism. Persuasion power you make the people understand your point and do what you need them to do. You need to be very strong negotiation skills.

      Well, since as was a child I used to watch all different kind of programs on brazilian tv. But things have been changing since then. Nowadays, there is violence, sex and too much futile advertising for consuption. Firstly, I can say that tv programs in my country are only rated by age and audience. Actually,  what's required is the profit. Doesn't matter if the program can provide knowledge, education or inspire someone in a field of study. Certainly, sometimes all we need is have some fun on tv, but we can't live depending only on this in an undeveloped nation. We need to give a range of options for people. But here in Brazil just cable tv has all those options, in other words it is provided only for the minority population who can pay it. Lastly, therefore, I think we must think of this issue because the tv is a device that can influence all people in family, as one of the first things we usually do, at least for most of people, is turn on tv

Im married and I have a little beautiful girl. Sometimes I feel upset with my life because Im almost 30 years old and I dont have my own house yet. Although its too difficult to buy one house in Brazil yet, in my case of course, for the reason that Im entered in middle class and the government doesnt give me any benefits or financial support or, sometimes, this financial support is not so good and it doesnt help so much. Definitely, to be in the margin of middle class is terrible, when you are a rich person, then you are rich enough to buy anything you want without huge worries and while you are poor, nowadays, the government helps you with many kind of income, so its good for big part of Brazilian population. Unfortunately, I have living from paycheck to paycheck these last years and because these issues, occasionally, I get nervous. However stuffs are changing, I decided open my own business, I know that bad moments will happen but good things are in the bigger number than them.

I know Amazon is the most common option in the world to buy books online, but in Brazil I prefer Saraiva rather than Amazon. Saraiva site is easier to use than Amazon, especially for us who speak Portuguese language. They have a huge amount of items to choose and send us quickly and safety. The prices are almost the same that we can reach in a brick and mortar store. Sometimes the prices are even better than regular stores. They accept many payment options and the delivery is really fast. The navigation is easy and intuitive, at a first time you try you probably will have no problems. Buying in sites abroad could have tax issues and you could be surprised with a amount of money that you do not waiting to pay for. Only when a cant find the book that I wish is this site I try other like Amazon or E-bay.

      In my opinion the law recently created here in Brazil in some cities, who establish that is prohibited smoking in close public places, even in pubs,it is very correct and helpful for all no-smokers like me. I remembered years ago when I use to go to parties and my clothes were all smelling cigarettes in the next day, that's was terrible! Unfortunately this is a city law and that's why it still isn't apply in all over the country. Despite of all I think things are getting better every day, my father tells me that when he was young it was allowed smoking everywhere, like buses and planes, can you imagine such thing? Nowadays this would be an outrage! I think that laws and rules are created due safety concerns and must be respected.  If something doesn't fit with your lifestyle you can solve the problem on your own, there are always a solution. For example: if I want to smoke, I have to do in the allowed places; If I have a dog, I can't take him at places where dogs aren't allowed. Sometimes people make a mountain out of a mole hill and the solution is perfectly reasonable.%%

Both of them do the same work, so their payment should be the same. Some skills are completely differente from the 1900s, maybe because of the women's feminism movement, but there are lot of things the change yet! Nowadays is completely normal when men and women go to a restaurant and split the bill, women drive cars sometimes better than men, but they haven't the same privileges as men in other questions, like in the politic.

To play, two teams are assembled on a rectangular field. Each team has a goal, a metal frame covered with a big net, that is located behind its team members. The object of the game is to score points by kicking the ball into the opposing teams goal. The team with the most points wins the game. Playing soccer, you're not allowed to touch the ball with your hands, except the goal keeper, if you do this, the other team have a special fault against the goal keeper.

As my wife has a good job too we don't have financial problems, of course sometimes things aren't so easy but we don't live from paycheck to paycheck. We have just one child, a daughter to be precise. She finished elementary school last year, at that time she was studying in a private school and when we are going to enroll her to another private school for high school she passed in a test to study in a very good public school so we are saving some money since then. At my job I work every other weekend so some times is a little upset to work on weeks but it is not a bit deal. We usually have two small vacations per year - each one last twenty days.

On the other hand, the comunity needs are continuously increasing, specially that ones which are close or related to business going on nearby.

      I'm military in Brazilian Army since when I was 19 year. Two pillars governing military career: discipline and hierarchy. Theses two points play a important role in the culture of my work. In my job there are strict rules that have to follow for everybody who serve there. Somebody say excessive discipline limits the creativity and human potential, but this aspect is very relevant to the military profession. The hierarchical structure sometimes creates a distance, but does not prevent an environment of mutual respect, camaraderie and fellowship flourish. About hours of work, we spent weeks in military operations away from ours families. These activities strengthen the bonds of friendship, because we realize that we depend on each other very much so that the mission is well fulfilled. Anyway, in this apparent harsh environment we can make great friends and live unforgettable moments.

Sales end of the year was weak, and demonstrates how it is the expectation for the future, how unpleasant circumstance right now. The cost of living is growing up, brazilians economic has ongoing issue. Maybe after middle at this year it turn around because de cup of the world is here.

      I have never seen performing art that was unique in my city or other citier near here. Cirque du Soleil, wich is a one-if-a- kind circus always came in Brazil. Everybody who had seen the performance style said that is one of a kind. The problem is the high price tickets, about US$ 200 I think it not well the worth the money. It is recognized as one of Japan's three major classical theaters Kabuki noh and bunraku. But Kabuki is a kind of traditional form of theater. I watched in Dicovery Theater about Kabuki and heritage. Theres nothing like Kabuki, the main and the most experienced Sakata Tojorou was considered cultural heritage life from UNESCO. There just men because, in the past, women were accepted but they had man problems with whoredom, and now just man acts dressing like woman. Kabuki in an art form rich in exaggerated acitons performed by actors. The actor uses specially old-fashioned form of typically japoneses movement. Also, ambience is aided with live performad mucis using traditional instrument named shamisen ( it has three strings) and one singer who sing drama and tragedy songs. If I have been opportunity Id like to go Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo.%%

      In the Brasil, the the trend is to give tests to students more often like SIMAVE or PAAE, it's to avaluate how our education is, the quality. I like these tests because we can see where the students are failing and take decisions about this. Tests that the students need pass (Math, Sicence) is important to avaluate if he can go to another degree or not. Bad part is that a test doesn't countain enough information about what was teaching at the classroom. Online classes I think that's a good idea too, and here have many of them!

The refrigerant is unlimited for a fixed price. The serves are very friendly and attentive. Other good point to eat at Outback is the desserts. They have many good options, but my favorite is the Cinnamon Oblivion: Vanilla ice cream, cinnamon croutons, cinnamon apples, whipped cream, strawberries and caramel sauce. The only problem is te price, because all the things are a little expensive.

You must be thinking.Yes, even with a female president, and many women in leading roles in business, politics and in their homes. The entire society nowadays has some prejudices about women that prove that women still are considered lower than men. For example when a woman is driving and something wrong happened is normal that people say &quot;It had to be a woman&quot;. It isn't just on Brazil that Brazilian women are treated with prejudice. Is normal that in other countries when a Brazilian woman is traveling the people treat her as a easy woman.

      Media have been changed a lot for the last decades. I remember to watch TV in a very old model. Sometimes it was black and white. Can you believe in it? We did not have access to cable, Internet, computers and HD.  These new medias change our lives completely. Nowadays, we can have access to the world in one click. People can study, date, have fun, read books and watching films easily from a sofa. In my opinion we can have an easy life with these new medias however; we are losing part of our day-to-day relationships. These days, we are in contact with people through Internet.  We are texting people, and no talking or calling each other anymore. Of course, there are good points as well; you can keep in touch with some people who you are far from them and you can find old friends using Facebook or Skype.

Weekends activities or maybe a weekly task when they have to work together. Maybe it could be a good situation to give them a opportunity to share their opinions and analyse the company. It is very important for a leader know listening to their employees.

B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!

Now i fell strongly that there are a most profund problem, a human problem. The superficiality of television is a demonstration of the superficiality of the public mind.

      Talk about education in Brazil is too complicated. The best high school educations are the federal education, that you don't have to pay nothing. Almost all good professionals came from a federal institute. The main problem is that everyone who studied on a federal institution coursed a private school before it. This is necessary because the schools in Brazil aren't good enough to prepare to a federal university. So, the free university is available only for rich persons. Is it an antagonistic situation.

      One effective management strategy is keep in touch with all the employees. The manager has to maintain his' door open to all employees. In this way, they will fell free to talk their concerns. Other thing is: They have to trust each other to have a effective team. In order to trust each other, first, they have to know their colleges better. Is important to have team building activities, like a happy hour. Maybe is a good idea choose a place and a day of the week to everybody go after work just to relax. Making this a tradition is going to be really good for the team, because we work better with somebody we know well. For a example, we had a college that was really annoying during the work and it was so difficult to work with him. But, he was good in his work and after we know him better out of work, we founded that he was a great guy after a couple of beers. So, getting know each other better was a great way to make our work more effective.

The deficiency in education begins in primary school and extends to the third degree.

I'm all for this changes in Brazil education system, is becoming modern. But, on the other hand, I'm against them when they don't educate in the right way. For example, when one student fail in certain grade they offer another oportunities to do more tests and if the student continue failing they pass the student whatever the grade that it get.

      Actually, I'm pessimistic about the future. Nowadays the people in the world consume more. The pollution rise everyday because all campanies think only in their profit, they don't think about the world problems. There aren't many people thinking about how we can educe the emissions of CO2 or how we can use something replecing the petroleum. In the other side, the human is very intelligent and maybe we will see someone suprising us. If we reduce our consumes and we research about alternative energies, we can repair the world problems.

      Corporate Social Responsibility is a global trend that began in the last century. It starts from the idea of companies think about creating and producing products that damage unless the nature and make life better in the community. These actions should be implemented by managers in companies of all departments and especially the production manager. Which is much more related to the production environment and raw materials used in the product. Nowadays the society as a whole is increasingly demanding of companies and their employees to make products within environmental standards. The best examples come from big company using Social Responsibility, as well as a way to promote their products. One example of company who have worries about the environment is the AMBEV. The company has been improving their techniques with the goal of producing more, reducing the consumption of natural resources. Today, 97% of solid waste is recycled and sold as raw materials for other industries

      About the behavior in Brazil Most of people are very friendly in Brazil. Unless youre working or in a fancy party, people just dont mind too much about behavior. However, you have to follow a few steps to be a good guest. Bring something if youre visiting someones house. Hosts love small gifts. Mingle with the other guests and smile some times. Dont be so much critical.  Dont talk too much over football. People get annoyed some times. Of course there are people rude as well. Speaking too loud bothers me a little bit. Not taking off your shoes when youre visiting someones house is a kind of impolite habit in my opinion. Say goodbye before you go. I think thats it.

      The gender differences is a polemic topic in Brazil. Basically, the woman's role since the last century has been changed into a modern way. Today the women likes to split the bills, they are more independent, and they are less worried about raising children. In the other hand, the men now don't have the responsibility for the house. They can share this things with the woman, and they are doing more domestical taks and also raising the children, isn't it? Nowadays the role of the women in the business is getting more important, but they still earns less money than men. I think that this fact will be changed soon, isn't it! Because women more and more are dominating several aspects in the society such they had never done before. Will the women dominate the world? I can bet!

      Green Business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its parto to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more fore certains items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about food I eat, so I amke sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating halthy food.

      I believe that successful people necessarily have to be a plan. If you live your life and go walking with no direction, you can achieve success, but probably it was more a kind of lucky than competence. What I mean is to establish a plan, with goals, how to reach goals, when, who can help on this, if something go wrong how to find an alternative? An appropriate study of the real benefits to achieve that plan ended, how it will impact in your life, or if there's another better options. But all this preparation to ride on you action plan and reach the main objective most need to be executed. So, a single plan that still on paper or on head of the people won't be a success! And for me, this is one of the most difficult part of the road to success. Is the time when the mistakes and adversities comes to real life and puts you in front with the problems, most of them never forecasted! Here comes a new trait, that is the capacity to change our mind, let go of habits of thought, and admit that go for another way could be better than persist on the original way.%%

This week rained everyday and a lot of pictures were received by our office. Pictures showing cars under water and terrible traffic jam. One of interviewed people said that he stayed in the traffic three hours before getting home after a hard day of work. It's just an example of what was a common situation this year. In addition, poor residents had their houses flooded after long time raining. It's a consequence that our city is used to see every year, but this year it was different. It wasn't raining as specialists were expecting. As a result, our reserves of water were low. We can conclude that our government is not prepared for what happen every year. We have times of dry and times of a lot of rain. So, they must do something to deal better with it next year.

      I enjoy playing chess. Chess is a game played between two persons on opposite sides of the board. You have to think, it's not a dice game. It is divided in 64 squares of alternating colors; just black and white. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king ; 1 queen ; 2 rooks ; 2 bishops ; 2 knights and 8 pawns. At the end of the game, the winner is the one who get to do checkmate the opponent's king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position where he can't escape for capture. In other words, he can not move. Each piece has to do a specific movement. For instance, pawns can only move forward, it means that he is not allowed to move passing over the others pieces. The most valuable piece is the queen, she can do almost anything. Always the queen... Maybe it's not so easy to explain just talking. I have an idea! Let's go home!

      Brazil is a big country and there are many cultures in there. Some of these people are italians, germans, portuguese and africans. Because of that, we don't have a unique etiquette. Depends of the side of the country you can do things that other side is not polite.  But in general we can follow some tips: - When we go to other house for lunch on sundays it's polite we bring a dessert or even some meal. - For a friend's party it's very common each people bring your drink and some times the ice for keep the drink cold. - And of course, here in Brazil we touch too much times. We can kiss and hug anytime a person.

Before, the public schools were very good and respected, so you could put your son there and be sure the education was suitable.

      I really love cinema, I see almost all kinds of movies, but one type is my favorite... animations. Good animations have a light history that pleases the whole family and all ages. Disney/Pixar studios sometimes hit with fun and catchy characters as Frozen, his latest release, and who did not remember of Shrek or &quot;How to train your dragon&quot; of DreamWorks studios. There are also other studios that occasionally surprise the public. Some people think animations a silly story for kids, but not all animations are made only for children and as the story is &quot;silly&quot;, I think it agreeable ( an anti-stress &quot;therapy&quot;). Is not only light and enjoyable story that pleases me, but also the increasingly detailed computational effects e.g., the movement of the clothes of the characters and the texture of snow in some scenes of Frozen. Finally, to like it or not of animations is a matter of personal liking, and as we say here in Brazil, ... &quot;Personal preference is not discussed&quot;.

      Has a happy country beat, but if you pay attention to the lyrics, well, it's not that happy! The singer begin saying that he misses his old home, that was sold so that he could buy a trailer or something like that, by the mall. And at this point he's just complaining about the size of the kitchen, that he works until 17:00 o'clock - which I guess it's more than what he was used to. And then there's a phylosophical question: 'What's the sense of all this home improvement?' Again and again, he points that things was best before all this improvement/ progress thing. I think that the singer has a good voice and a good point, so I do recommend the song, it make us think about this capitalism nonsense.

I just don't believe in paying more for a thing if it can cost less in another place. Actually, I don't have a real place to shop. When I want something, I really go out and search for the better price. Sometimes, I decide do spend more money in a special thing. Then, I spend a lot of hours or enough time to find it.

Sometimes, I find a really great discount and it makes me happy. The only reason for me to visit a mall is to relax.

      The most important thing to me in life is do my best to be happy, following the human and laws and treating people as I want to be treated. Simple as that. Well, so far, life has teached me a lot of important lessons. I've learned that I can't regret about past, I can't try to guess future, and the only thing that left to me is enjoy present. Sometimes it's hard to do that, but when I realize that I forget it, I try to put everything in that context to move on. Life teached me to not take me so serious and try to laugh about me every single moment. Honestly, this is the hardest thing to practice every day. Another thing that is very important to me, is the fact that life will happen in yours own terms, not in my terms. Will happen what has to happen, and not what I want to happen. It's the advice that I can give to others: life will just happen we have to accept and deal with that, without fear, angry, frustration or rage.

      In Brazil, gender differences are a big problem politic and social. Nowadays a lot of women are working and occupying the central economy importance in Brazilian family, being like men were in the past: the holder house finances. However, the big difference as that the women have minor wages than men, in some cases even if the women have higher schooling level. In contradiction, the women are occupying more and more highest levels in big companies in Brazil. Today, the highest political position in this country is occupied by a woman: Dilma President. Perhaps, all this changes  is a result of a lot of changes and social movements that occurred in Brazil and in the world along the years, like access to education, market needs and, maybe, a change mentality of the function of the woman in the society. But, the conclusion is the a lot of changes are still well welcome.

      My name is Nathalia. I live in Brazil. I work as a video editor and my schedules are never the same. Usually I get up at 8:30 am, this when I don't work after midnight. After get up take a shower and have breakfast, then I drive to my work. I don't take any train, because unfortunally in my city there's no one, we only have a subway, but it's lines doesn't cross all the city. When I arrive at work, I turn on the computer and start runing programs to edit my videos. Is very good to be an editor in my opinion, because almost always you have a work room just for you. They are small and cold, but always silent to work and nobody bothers you. At noon I go to lunch and then I come back to work and stay there till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, then I go home and wash my clothes, study, do some physical exercises and stuff like that. I always go to bed after midnight

      Is quite common in Brazil's college to give students tests once a month. If the student fails, he can continue in regular classes until December, when he gives just a final test. It's unusual at college there are special classes to help Brazilian students and is pretty normal lots of students fail in final test. I'm totally against that because most of them work all day and study all night. Another trend is technology in education. More and more students get degrees online. I'm all for it because you can study whenever and wherever you want.

      In Brazil there a lot of legendary creatures because our folklore is so vast. Saci-Perer is one of the most popular here between Brazilians. Everybody studied or will study about Saci-Perer one day at school. Says the legend that the Saci-Perer was a little boy who wore a red cap, red shorts and smoked a pipe. This boy has just one leg and because of that he jumps all the time.According to the legend he lost his leg playing caponier. His principal characteristic is to do tricks where he passes. He is playful, has fun with the animals and people. He causes some disorders like do the beans burn and hide some objects. I really don't believe in those kind of legendary creatures, but until nowadays there are some people who believe, especially the ones who live in the countryside. Those creatures are also very commom in children's stories. Every year we celebrate the folklore here in Brazil and in this time all of them are remembered.

      The metropolitan cathedral of Nossa Senhora de Aparecida was located in Brasilia, Brazilian capital. Is a building with a modern architecture designed by Oscar Niemeyer, one of the greatest architect in the world and a famous modernist designer. The place was inaugurated in 1974, having a unique shape with sixteen parabolic arches wrapping the structure resulting an appearance of a crown. For visitors the main impact is inside, due to the parabolic form of its arches the roof is too strait giving you a different feeling like you are being tight or pressed, so is like you arent in a normal place. In the interior of the construction there are a huge number of glasses in soft colors, different tons of blue blend with white, forming an abstract figure, likely a wave. Another different feature of this place is the illumination, as consequence of its shape the light of the sun stay in interior for a long time during the day.

      Write about &nbsp;technology is a pleasure for me, since I work with it. Im IT Manager at a big company, and technology is part of my daily life. Ive been involved with technology since 1999. I saw the internet to be developed and become a part of everybodys life. I saw the the first mobiles phones (analogue) arise &nbsp;and becoming smartphones, like Alexander Grahan Bell once said &quot;The day will come when the man at the telephone will be able to see the distant person to whom he is speaking. As a network enthusiast, I think the most impressive invention and development &nbsp;in the last 20 years was the optical multiplexing. In 1999 the average throughput of the internet link was about 128kbps. Today we are talking about 200Mbps, Its 1600x faster. The most striking point is that in some cases we are using the same physical layer (Optical Fibre) and it is possible, because of the evolution of multiplexing concept. Technology has no limits, and a good exercise which we should to do is write about this subject in 2034 &nbsp;and then compare with we are writing today. I'm sure it will be amazing.%%

      Have women totally achieved equal rights by the 21st century? We all know that women and men roles in our country have changed over the years. Since middle 1900's women have got other occupations besides housekeeping and raising the kids. Our mothers have split their time between their jobs and family since then. Nowadays it's totally social accepted. But do we see women at the same positions as men? Do we see women as high executives, directors, politicians, etc.? So, I believe the first question was answered. Theoretically, women have achieved same rights but in practice we still see men as the empowered majority. This way, we do have something to be fighting for: real equal rights and opportunities.

Let's say I have to do a composition about Sergio Vieira de Mello, former United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights killed in Iraq. The first thing I do is gather as much information as possible about him. Then, in the central part of a paper sheet, I put his name enclose in a circle and I use arrows to linking his name with each subheading related to its legacy.

      The technology has changed my life. I always worked with it. My college was about it. The whole world can't live anymore without the technology and their products, the world would completely stop. For example, I can't see myself without my iPhone, iPod, MacBook, internet, Google... And I'm sure that most of people also think the same. Hang out without my smartphone? Is like walking naked around the city. Be without a connection? No way. As a social media analyst, the technology is essential for my life. Perhaps sometimes we get overwhelming and use it more than we could but nowadays it's turning in an usual thing. Actually, we can name this current age as &quot;I share therefore I am&quot;, in other words, the people are getting away from another in the real world but are completely connected in the virtual world. Share our thoughts is more normal than have a conversation face to face. Maybe it is all about Matrix, who knows?

      There is no doubt that gender differences has been reduced over the years, whereas there are still much work to do in other to keep women up with men. If we consider how was our society twenty years ago we will see how women have increased their participation. The first path was, in my view, the right to vote and be voted. Until 1970s women couldn't vote because they were considered incapable for that. Nowdays it sounds complety weird and unimaginably but had happened. It's important to point that four years ago we had our first woman elected as a president. There is another fact that shows an historic moment to the genders equality: in 1988 was enacted our new constitution where is predicted that man and women have the same rigths and obligations. We can compare the question in gender differences and its evolution with the racial matter and the slavery. The first path is recoganize the rigths formaly, like happened when the slavery was abolished and, considering genders differences, woman could vote and be voted. But the main path and the most dificult one is abolished the society prejudice. It takes too much time and even today we see woman beeing judge as inferior to man.%%
