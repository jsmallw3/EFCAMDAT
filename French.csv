      I have been writing a survey about discrimination and I need someone to explain some points:First of all, do you know how The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (SDA) has been applied until now?How would we have to proceed if we were a victim of discrimination?Who should we contact and where?In case of unlawful harassment, can we file a complaint against our employer ?What will be happening if you do it?Does it really risky?What should we do if the employer takes reprisals against ourselves?Is there someone really competent to help us and to explain us what we have to do exactly if you lose your job after a discrimination claim?How much will it cost if we take a lawyer?Why are there any Government stocks or charitable institution to bear the cost if it's too expensive for us?Thanks a lot for your help!

      People are often suffering from career path confusion. Sometimes they make a good job or try to do their best. Even if they get a promotion, they are dissastified because it's just to do good impression with the hierarchy.At the beginning of a professionnal life, people don't think much about their job or career. They only want to keep theirs jobs and they are not confident.More later, things can be different, they have with the experience  a different point of view and  more open minded. Yet, for a experienced person, changing his carrer path can be complicated because he has to detemine what he likes more in his job and what jobs or activities could make him happier.For this, It is necessary to know his own personnality to find his right direction.

      &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, by Terence Malik, was a very expected movie, because it has won the golden palm at Canne's festival. Those who like emotional scenes and beautiful pictures will enjoy the movie. Brad Pitt, as an ordinary father of the 1960's, brutal and idealist, is excellent. The relationships between this father and his sons, who admire their father and hate him at the same time, are very realistic. The movie would have been perfect if it were not so long. The most important part of the movie is about the story of human beings and the way we can communicate with God and the dead persons. Theses spiritual intentions turn to ridiculous scenes when two lovely dinosaurs appear on the screen. That beautiful movie confirms that it is difficult to show the God's hand with words and pictures.

      My friend told me, his company has difficulties with the staff. This company is working at the airport. Some blue-collar workers dont respect the behaviour management. Sometimes, when the manager asks them to execute a work, they dont want to do it. If the boss gives a sanction, they go on strike. Thats the big problem. There is maybe a solution: The rule must be well-defined and right written. When the company hires a new worker, she has to inform people. If any one doesnt respect the contract, he will be fired. The boss and the managers will take time to think before meeting. A report will be written to describe the rules, the tasks, and the responsibility for doing a part of work. Maybe the work will be better done.

      In France now, the life is difficult and a lot of people are in trouble with their finances. Rent are very high and, if you don't want to pay a rent you have to buy your house and to take a mortgage, witch is the same thing. Really it cost approximativly 30 % of your income and, after, the cost of live is high, and higher if you live in a town. Have a car is very expansive because of insurance. Is the same for your house : you must have an insurance. For the medical outcome, there is in France a good system, but it's going to be worse now because of the differents governments. They begin step by step to change the system of personnal protection. I think, that, in fact, if you take care of your budget and if you have a good job you can live. But lot of peoples are unlucky not in that case.

      Right now i'm going to talk about finances. Nowadays it's important to save money. Of course, we need to spend money on necessary stuffs like food, bills or paying taxes. But because we can't plan exactly our future, saving money is very useful to prevent some unexpected events. Now we could lose a job very quickly. It's very shameful to lose a roof over your head just because you didn't save enough ! About myself, i'm describing as someone who try to save money. Because unfortunately money is necessary if you want to be free. When you borrow some money, you're lose freedom by owing money to someone. And some fees still increasing when wages stay at the same level. But, thinking to much about money isn't good. You need as well enjoy moments of your life and relax your mind by partying sometimes.

      I live at the Swiss border where the price of real estate business is not affordable. .Not only for French people but also for Swiss citizens. The main deal is that one: Swiss people allow us to work in their country and we allow them to live in our country. It's normally a win-win situation for both. Swiss people don't want to live In France because they dislike our mentality; nevertheless it is the only way for them to become owner, as the price is so expensive in Geneva and less in France. This problem bring us a lot of trouble about for example the traffic jump. There is 100 000 people who cross the border every day. Consequently it is just a nightmare to drive in Geneva. Swiss people tend to close their border for job and traffic jump to protect themselves. All this stuff is not so easy to deal with. This town wasn't built to meet so many people.

      I experienced some changes in my lifestyle recently. As I mentioned in a precedent written work, I have finished my studies last year (in June). Thus, my position about money has radically changed. My parents don't help me anymore for my rent, and my grant is now over. I am in my 'job-hunting phase' since early August. I sent a lot of curriculum vitae for many many job applications, but of course none of them was followed by an interview. I only got form emails of rejection ('thank you for your interest [bla bla bla] not enough experience for us' final point), or even no response at all. It's really annoying and stressful (I need money to live). Thankfully I keep in touch with my friends. It let me forget just for few hours the toughness of reality. They are lucky and happy, in couple, and each of them has a job and a secure future (at least for three years). Sometimes it makes me a little sad (you know, that feeling of being the fifth wheel). On the other hand this allows me to keep hope. Perhaps I shouldn't had done such long studies. But now, what's done is done.%%

      Even if I think that conserving natural resources is important, I have serious reservation about green business because I witnessed, in my professional life, how it can be used as a marketing stunt or a political spin. Its interest depends on products or services which are said being green. Regarding farming and food, green business is without doubt very useful. Green vegetable, green meat or even green wine are not only ecofriendly but have also a much better taste. Whats more: Consumers know that products are truly green. Then, in Europe, to claim being green, an agro food industry needs to be involved in a certification program. By contrast, I'm quite dubious about green business in some others sectors like energy, for example. Wind power, or solar power is much more expensive than power produced with unrenewable energy. Consumers or taxpayer have to pay for it.That could seriously endanger economic growth that is already low. So I do believe that environmental sustainability needs to be linked with economical sustainability. We can't say: I want to use green energy, no matter what it costs. We have to wait until the scientists be able to produce cheap renewable energy. Then, and only then, I'll buy into that great idea.%%

I used to enjoy ridding a bike to go working, I was a sort of jock, but I can't anymore. Now, I'll become a workaholic in studies ans accept the way life is coming to me.

      I definitly prefer to buy green product over brand which dosen't care of th environement.  But if you really want to choice the right product, with a minimum of information on the energy used, the packaging biodegradable or ,ot and so on you will discover that it's not evident to choose the right one. Sometimes the package is green and the product looks like it is environment frendly or bio but finally you cannot find any relevant information on the way it has been elaborated. So i think that if you are very motivated to use only real green products you have to go out of your way to find the right product.so if you do not have the time and the money to do this, which is my case you could start by changing your day to day behavior by for example using cermique cup instead of plastic glass, cooking yourself instead of buying prepared meals.

      Is there a real gender equality in France ? Today, most of the women work, but are they get paid as a men ? No, French women are paid 30% less, than men. Is interesting to understand what could justify this difference. There's two items who justify it : the pregnancy and the life expectancy. Women can be pregnant, and then stop to work for few month, and still get paid. On the other hand, statistics show that women live more longer than men, so they are longer retired. Furthermore, in a company, it's not really usual to have a woman as a CEO, perhaps the possible pregnancy explain it either. Isn't it difficult to have his CEO away for her maternity ? The gender equality in a company, as in the french society is still a challenge.

To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural ressources as mucs possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable matrials in their prodcuts and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certains items.
