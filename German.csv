      Hello, i''m stefanie. I''m a psychology student and trainee. At the moment i make an internship in a market research company. I like this job, because i always sit on the desk, write emails or talk on the phone. I usually take a break. My work always starts at 9 o'clock and ends at 18 o'clock. I don't like in this job, that i never go on business trips or have a meeting. Sometimes it's boring because i have nothing to do.

      Now I am retired, but before in my working life ( as a teacher ) I remember especially one colleague with whom I worked together very closely. She managed the class and I came in the classroom for learning support. Sometimes it was necessary to take out of the classroom some pupils to teach them seperately. Othertimes we taught together in the classroom. It was a perfect teamwork. We didn't need great preparations, because fortunately we had the same ideas of education and didactic. The two of us got on really well together. The only think we got a little problem sometimes were that she came originally from the south of Germany and I from the nord. So she used some words I found nearly ridiculous and the same happened to her but always we resolved it with humor and laughing.

      Comparing the two demographic groups there is definitely a higher percentage of current magazine buyers to be recognised in the18- to 24-year-old male group. Competiton products in the female group are 100% higher than in the male group. The purchasing power in the female group is much lower than in the second group, however the estimated increase within the next 15 years is expected to succed 12 % in the female group whereas the male group's estimated increase is supposed to reach only 2%. Prognoses concerning the development of demographic size came to the result that the number of the female demographic group will increase from 25 million in 2010 up to 30 million in 2025 and the male demographic group will decrease from 25 million in 2010 down to 20 million in 2025. The highly increasing purchasing power and the estimated increase of 15- to 19-years-old women who are supposed to purchase at least one magazine monthly by the year 2025 offers more potential for the magazine industry. Last but not least women generally prefer magazines to blogs and their interest in fashion, stories, culture is almost exhaustless.

      The King s Speech The King s Speech is rewarded with 4 Oscars. Does he deserves it (question mark) Well, the whole scenery, the costumes and the life in old London is as authentic as the main actors problem to speak like every normal guy. He gives a brilliant performance. Britain s King doesn t have any hope to get cured. His way to salvation is not easy and you feel with him step by step, so the film makes a very good job to transport the emotion s of concern, disappointment and hope from the film to the spectator. So the film deserves the Oscars, any how it is not the right choice for action lovers.

      To: xxx@hotmail.com CEO Century CC: xxx@1234.com Subject: New advertising campaign for Century! Highly honored John Smith, As you certainly know our Advertising Associate Elizabeth Hamilton has sent me three images and slogans for our new advertising campaign. Now it is up to me to choose the most appropriate image and slogan for the new campaign. I would like to inform you that I have decided to pick the third one. The reason why I have chosen this image and slogan is quiet simple! Considering that our target group is stylish and classic men, who are earning good money, it is an obvious choice. The main question we should ask ourselves is where we can find those men. The answer is rather easily. They are spending their vacation on the golf track. To sell our product we should try to convey an impression of team-spirit. For that reason I think the slogan Golf and Century. The perfect team. Is the most convenient!

Therefore, I don't like to disgrumble Diana and to leave her out in the cold. Meeting all of you would have been a great pleasure for us that's out of question but there is no way to get out of our party. Would it be possible to postpone your invitation to next week or some possible evenings and the dinner will take place in our house. Is there any way you could imagine that. Both of us would appreciate if we could spend this evening together enjoying a delicious dinner. Let me know if you can make it. Best wishes Chris

She certailny didn't mean to offend you or anybody else at the evening.Although I'm not looking to give excuses, I did want to explain the reasons for putting her foot in it. Is just that, that we Germans know very well what it's mean, if a country stops thinking and speaking his mind. And as much she has been learning about this atrocious crimes, the more she is convinced to warn everybody what might be happened with fundamental politics. On that note, she tends to overlook the fact  a person's political attitude is private.I promise that she will never speak out of turn again. Once again, please do accept my and her sincere apologies. With my best wishes, Horst

      Hello, Im very pleased about your mail. That was a really scary experience, which you have made. I had my most awesome experience in winter holidays 1994. I was in a ski school, 9 years old, I was the last of my class and I had to help if somebody would fall down. But I fell down, nobody helped me, I lost my group and was alone in a huge ski-region. I didnt found my group and my tears were broken out. An old man asked me, what my problem are. I told him all and he helped me to find my family. Thats a story about one scary moment in my life. But now I will answer your questions and come back to the present. Sorry that I didnt wrote you before, but my job is frantically busy at present. However I dont want to talk about work. I have some news as regards to my private life: I fell in love with somebody. Im very happy and satisfied at the moment. Its great, isnt it? Bye, Alex

      Picture 1 reminds us that nature has its own way and we are not always able to do what we want to. Some day in the future, an asteroid will hit the earth and might as well destroy it. Sometimes we will have to watch and could not react or create. Mankind is not the king on earth. Picture 2 stands for ourselves not valuing our humble being enough. We often want to get more and therefore forget about the small things. Only money matters, no matter that we might risk our necks for a few moments of happiness.Picture 3 is the most serious of all the 3 pictures. It illustrates our manipulative association with our environment. We do not care enough for the next 10 generations. For example, oil is for us, now; our great-grandchildren will have to look after themselves. Unrenewable energies are cheaper at the moment compared to the not yet invented renewable energies, i.e. water power, wind power, etc.The images try to remind us that we are not the last people living on this earth.

Due to the fact that Frank is a very direct person, he always let you know what he thinks. That's exactly what I generally like about other people. However, not everyone at work is able to work with Frank's manner. Sometimes it comes to conflicts between my boss and Frank because both of them are very direct. But while Frank's directness is a positive characteristic, the straightforward manner of my boss comes along with an aggressive manner. So neither my colleagues nor I like to cooperate with our boss.

      Dear Ian, I was appalled when I heard about your plan to quit your job. Is it really necessary? Have you thought carefully about it? Nowadays it is almost impossible to find such a well-paid and secure workplace as yours. I understand that your phobia can be insufferable, but as your friend, let me propose a way to deal with your situation. I studied some facts about claustrophobia and how you could treat it. First of all, you should take professional help. In my oppinion, selftreatment or even more worse, capitulation is no choice. I read about the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Summarized, you learn to think in a more positive and rational way. You also may learn methods for dealing with symptoms. In many cases patients overcome their fear completely. A way to handle the symptoms temporarily could be a medication from a doctor. To me, it's a serious topic. May I invite you to a beer to talk about it face to face? There''s a nice outdoor bar in the city :-) I hope to hear from you soon Yours Thomas

I know, claustrophobia causes different symptoms like anxietey, panic, breathing problems, a racing heart or sweating and this is a big problem.

      Dear John,I'm very sorry to hear that you are experiencing a lot of stress at work at the moment. As I was facing the same problem some time ago, I came up with some strategies to reduce stress. Always remember that stress can not be eliminated but only reduced and that stress can be helpful, too, as people are able to get a lot done.Firstly, try to work out on a regular basis. Physical exercise does not only train your muscles but it also helps you calm down and relax. Furthermore, relaxation techniques like yoga make you feel centred and confident.Secondly, remodel your home. Make sure that your home is a place where you feel comfortable. It's not difficult. Just put up some flowers and paint some walls in soothing colours like light blue or green.Thirdly and most importantly, talk about your current problem to your friends, your family and also your colleagues. If you do that, they'll be more sympathetic and more willing to support you.See you soon and all the best,Paula

Third: When I will have reached my online exam, I'd like to apply for a job as a teacher in an adult education center. Maybe I could organize a book group for other fans of the english literature.

Alex and his three Droogs (his friends) are victims of the dumb society and roaming through the streets searching for a &quot;good&quot; fight with other gangs or innocent people. Despite that the main theme of the movie is about what &quot;goodness&quot; is. Is it just what we do because we have to so or is it what we do because we decide to do so. During the movie Alex will be manipulated with a special procedure through with Alex becomes unable to commit any crime because he will get ill every time he tries.

      The game is called Frisbee Bowling First we need is a bowling alley. The bowling alley will be measured in 8 meters x 3 meters. Next we need 10 plastic bottles and fill them with water. After this line up the bottles in rows. The first row includes 4 bottles, the next row 3, than 2 and finally 1 bottle. So we also have 10 bowling pins. The first player get the frisbee and have to take 2 shots. The aim is to knock down many pins with the 2 shots. For every knocked down pin, the player is scored one point. In case the player knocked down all 10 bowling pins (this calls a strike), the player takes 2 more shots. After this all points are added together. Finally the player with the most points wins the game. Lets start the game.

      We life in a world of an excessive media impact.We get overwhelmed with information. We pay attention mostly to headlines with bad news. In opinion I can  believe that there is any truth in that rumor. Celebrities become hunted where ever they are, and if there is something suspicious the reporters create a story out of that. Time will show us if there is something wrong with both of them. In the meantime life you live as best as you can and don't care about riche peoples problems.

      Hi kids, Mark an area of about 8 x 3 meters as the bowling alley. Use 10 plastic bottles as the bowling pins. Fill them half with water. Lines up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. Each kid gets a frisbee. Take up two shots on each turn. Every player gives a total of 10 turns. Try to knock down as soon as possible . The score is one point for each knocked down pin. If all bottles knocked down, you get a stricke. Then you takes two more shots. Add all the pints together. The kid with the most points wins. But we can only play when it isn't any wind.

      English is mandatory for my job in a German insurance company, even the communication with my colleagues happens in German. The headquarters is located in Germany, but my company has several branches in other countries and so I have to communicate with people from all around the world from time to time. Doing this without speaking English proficiently? No way. Thats the reason why I take language lessons at my company and at home. Speaking English fluently has a double positive effect. On the one hand it helps me to build my career, on the other hand speaking English is influencing my private life. The ability to talk with so many people helps me to broaden my horizon. For example when I'm on holiday in a foreign country I really like to the locals, because from my point of view it's the best way to get deep knowledge about the country you are visiting. So, for socialising with other people, in the job or in private, English is mandatory.

I'm really that kind of person who tends to buy green products, but to be honest, I'm very suspicious. On the one hand it's very laudable, that companies do more and more focus on sustainability. But on the other hand, I as a customer, ask myself the question: Do they really mean it? Does the CEO really do it by heart or is he just following advices from some marketing consultants? Another question I'm asking myself on this topic is: Can companies really keep pace with societies rising demand for green products? Isn't it inviting to lower one's sights when producing green products (i.e. using a lot fossil fuels to operate the manufacturing facilities) to produce even more &quot;green labeled&quot; products? So all in all: Yes, I go out of my way to buy green products, but not without researching deeply if &quot;green&quot; is really inside.

Women should pay a particular attention to their dress , they should dress modestly .When you're eating,  use your right hand. If one is invited to someone's home, it's polite to talk along a small gift. Compliment your host on the cooking.

I know about the advantages of a superstore such as employment opportunities, convenient one-stop shopping, revenue from sales taxes and business license fees etc.. However, these benefits can't even the drawbacks for our community. Several other citys have showen how a superstore destroyes the community character and competing businesses. Furthermore a superstore not just axes local jobs, the jobs offered by Super-Mart are low-paid and feature neiter social nor health benefits. A further consideration is the environment. Superstores boost pollution due to the high volume of traffic. In addition they decay local stores and thereby erode the pedestrian-friendly rout ways. These are only a few disadvantages for our community. A number of residents joined forces and prepared a petition to stop the planning of the Super-Mart. The group meets every Wednesday evening at the community center and we would be glad if you could manage it to visit our meeting next week.%% Yours sincerley, M. B.

      Good evening and welcome all together, I'm the friend of today's groom David and it's my pleasure to speak on this evening. I'd like to provide a toast to David and of course this wonderful couple. I want to thank you, parents from David and Maggi for inviting and organisation to the celebration. I know David a long time. Today, I'd like to mention a story that has happened in our vacation a few years ago. As we arrived in New York at the ariport, we have searched our rental car station. So far so good. We were on time, so we got the car we had booked. It was the car we have wished us for this vacation. We were fortune and satisfied about this. We put quickly our luggage into the car and tried to get out from the rental car area. As we had found the exit, the agent asked if it is all OK. David, the driver didn't unterstand the question and asked back: &quot;What will you have&quot;? Seconds later we both started laughing about this wrong english question because Davids English wasn't so good. The agent made a smile on his face and questioned again.%% David took this with his wonderful humor and we could start our trip. David and Maggi, I wish you a furtune future and a warm heart for each other the whole life.

      I believe that the future begins today. Every day you can hear about new technology. Mobile technology, TV-technology, economic technology for cars etc. makes more and more good progress. Especially the mobile technology is very helpful and interesting for the peoples. Mobile technology makes you independent. You can work where and when you want, you can communicate on several ways with your friends all over the world. I think this technology will become more and more important. It creates a new lifestyle. Moreover, it prevents the nature and the environment. Also the technology for recycling is very fundamental because our resources will get less. So we need to reuse our products or produce new articles from the used products. Furthermore we must reduce our consumption of raw materials. So it is important to produce cars, they dont burn up so much fuel and create less pollution. Hybrid cars are a good alternative. And the scientists search every day for better cars. Since the humans have understood the problems our lifestyle has to the environment, they work for new technologies for a better life for all peoples and for the nature. The future will become technical savvy.%%

      On the one hand robots are helpful, but on the other hand they are dangerous. The danger is that they can do simple works which until today undeveloped workers had done. What can these workers do in the future? They will lose their jobs and get poor and poorer. How will they earn money for living? Thats a great problem we have to resolve. Otherwise robots can do very dangerous work like working in a mine, deep in the ocean or in the space. For these jobs they are doubtless predestined. They can do boring and dirty jobs, too. Jobs humans hate to do. The automated factory is simply possible with the robots. They work more accurate than humans can do. And one point is they dont make mistakes; and they are able to make our lives more comfortable. For this works I think that the robots should be produced. I dont believe that they should copy humans and human skills.

      One of the most popular tourist feature is the Cologne Cathedral. The cathedral is the largest Gothic church in Northern Europe and has the second-tallest spires and largest facade of any church in the world. The choir has the largest height to width ratio, 3.6:1, of any medieval church. The construction of the Cathedral commenced in the 13th century and was completed- after many stops- in 1880. At that time, it was the world''s highest building. Another hallmark is the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. It is one of the most well-known constructions in Germany and is build as a triumphal arch in the late 18th century. The Munich Frauenkirche is considered as a hallmark, too. It''s a symbol of the Bavarian capital city and serves as a cathedral. Becauses the city administration prohibited buildings exceeding a height of 99 m, the church towers are with 109m widely visible. Of course there are other intresting points of interest like the castle in Wartburg, the Suspension Railway in Wupperta and many more- I could easily fill a book with all of them...

      I think it is very important to have rules for driving on the roads and the traffic. Otherwise everybody would make his own rules and then we will have more accidents and espechially more people who will die because of an accident. But it is also not good to establish laws. If this would happen everybody would get angry and work against the law or people forget a lot of the rules. I think in Germany we have too many traffic signs on the road.

      As nineteen-year-old I began my education as police officer, that''s twentyseven years ago. At that time it was not easy to start a training in a male profession, because it wasn''t usual, that women decided for this job. Sometimes it was not easy, because I felt to explain myself for taking this profession, especially in face of my colleagues. They didn''t believe, that a female could be a police officer just the same as a male. Nowadays, it is not possible to imagine the job without women. In the last 27 years I switched my activities inside this job several times. In 2006 I was concerned in preparation and implementation for the soccer worldcup. I draw up the security concept by the police, in this job I had contact to the soccer teams on Frankfurt airport. That was a great job! After that, I changed my activity once more and took the job in a leading position. In near future, I hope to get a job in a foreign mission. It is not harmless and safe, but it is a new challenge.

It''s fantastic, how the genre suddenly is changing. I like it! &quot;Archive&quot; are unique in live concerts. You can feel their passion, their commitment to the music.

      I think laws are important. They regulate human interaction and thus ensure order. Sometimes it ist difficult to understand international and national laws, but they are correct and important. We currently have introducted a new law. As of now, we must do no more drugs in the trash. If you do that but you have to expact with a delicate fine. This has become dncessary because many people have done this in the past. It meant that many chemicals got into the drainage system, then into the treatment plant, and from there into the groundwater and further into the fields and woods. This allowed pollutions such as antibiotics get into the grain or other foods. We have a responsibility with regards to our enviroment. Therefore it is important that laws ensure that people do not deal ruthlessly with resources or irresponsible with toxins. From my perspective, it would make sense already teach the importance of responsibility for the enviroment children. Perhaps one would have to punish less.

Illnesses like cancer can be fought with further developing medicin. Elder people can profit from the new technology of telephone conferences. Furthermore there will be improvements in the pollution. The communication between the countries will be improved by technology. But on the other side there will be more computers that determine our freetime. Less sport and fewer appointments with friends will be the effects. That's horrible. So I'm both pessimistic and optimistic.

But it is a common practice to take a small present, like flowers or a bottle of good wine, with you. Upon arriving, guests will be offered a pre-dinner glass of sparkling wine. This glass is not supposed to be taken to the table. Guests talk to each other and enjoy this glass before having dinner. The cutlery for the different courses is to be used from outside to inside, that means the first one left and right from the plate is for the first course, the second one for the main course, and so on. The dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. The glass for red wine is a bigger one than for white wine. I guess it's needless to mention, that guest are not expected to burp or speak with a mouth full. After the dinner party a host will be happy to receive a thank you call.

      In my opinion, a green business is supposed to contribute to the sustainability of our nature . A green business is environmentally friendly. Maybe solar panels are used to produce power from the sun. Or the business has green roofs, built with soil and grass, in order to reduce energy consumption. Plant and food waste can also be used to produce energy. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible. Some people are motivated to conserve nautral resources as well. Others simply prefer to use environmentally friendly products in their homes. Of course, I do believe it is good to reuse things. Thus, I choose green brands over that aren't green. Since I am having a baby it is important to me that I am buying healthy food. So I make sure to shop at green stores.

      Theres no much I can say about urban criminality. As proud citizen of a little city in southeast Germany, sometimes I can read about shoplifting or Teen's criminality but also this kind of petty crime is rare. Its a common knowledge that violence and criminality direct correlate to social Poverty, what is not the case in rich southern states like Baden-Wttemberg and Bavaria. However increasingly violence and criminality rates can be observed in states like Berlin, Bremen and Nordhein-Westphalien. According to the last German Police crime statistics (2012) most common crimes are fraud in debit and fraud with stolen credit cards. Moreover burglary increased in the last few years. The discrepancies between South and north Germany are more apparent by comparing the number of delicts and the crime clearance quote per state: the number of delict per 100.000 inhabitants in Sachsen-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und Schleswig-Holstein exceeds the mark of 7000 whereas in Bayern and Baden-Wttemberg present a rate from about 5000 delicts per inhabitant.The crime clearance quote in Bayern and Baden-Wttemberg is up to 60% whereas in Nordhein-Westphalien und Schleswig-Holstein they are just under 50%. In face of these fact it seems clear that there is only one way how government can guarantee low criminality rates and peace: by building a strong social network to their citizens.%%

It's also important so seek an mentor. The mentor could advice and support you. That's very helpful to get promotions, for example. So by being an expert in office politics, you're able to climb up the job ladder. Improve your skills in playing the game. For example, collaborate with your colleagues. Successful colleagues should get your mentor. Just ask them for their advice. Don't be shy. But, don't understand office politics as a war. Don't compromise your ideals. Do not being deceptive or placing blame. Instead, get to know your colleagues, try to understand them and show them respect. Is it also important, not chatting only with your colleagues. Seek the conversation with your boss. Get in mind, your boss could be your biggest advocate.

Theres a very easy rule which silverware to use: Take it from the outside of your plate to the inside. Every course is served on a different plate, so that flavours of the different courses do not mix. If you have your mobile phone with you, do not use it while you are sitting at the table. It is very unpolite to use it for phone calls, messages or even to look on it frequently. You better switch it off or leave it at home. One thing is even worst than using your mobile phone at the table: talking with a full mouth. You should never do that!

Only if made out of clear defined ingredients and strictly following a recipe, this beer is entitled to wear the brand &quot;bavarian beer&quot;. The ingredients are hop, malt and water and the law is one of the oldest in europe, it was signed in 1516 ! In these days round about 30.00 breweries exists in bavaria, almost each small village and monastery have had his own, small production. Nowadays the number of breweries is quite smaller, 620 were still remaining in 2012, but the production of this breweries has increased enormously.  And the bavarians are still very attached to their traditional beer and buy it, drink it and enjoy it.

Gender differences, they still exist everywhere, but are they not only physical but psychological important? Is it fair to be treated by your gender - especially in business. For exampel: I can't understand why women still earn less than men in the same positions. Why do politicians talk about a quota for women in big companies? It should be normal to hire women for leading positions as it is reportet that they have more interpersonal skills and are succesful leaders. Is this the result of beeing hundrets of years only mothers and housewifes? Do women still need to fight for their rights? It is a fact that women have to work harder than men to get the same position and the same salary. Another example: Why are more women working as nurse than men? It's a job that men physically could do better but the salary is bad. Is it really because mainly men make the decisions of whom to pay what? Would a quota for women be helpful to reach more gender equality?

Houses for the workers were built and the workers settled down. You can still see these working-class quarter in the city with terraced houses in the south. Nowadays those have private owners, but you can still feel the flair of the past. The most houses in the city were destroyed in the second world war by the alliert, because there had been much armaments industry there. After the war, in the buildings were established. High, big buildings that appeal like cement bunkers, which would never win any sixties and seventies of the last century the most beauty contest.

At this school the lessons are more practical oriented and emphasizes more to practical achievements over 5 years. But it has no good reputation between the parents, so often social deprived children or low learner strand on this kind of school. The Realschule was devised as a middle between the Hauptschule and the Realschule with an expanded general education over 6 years. Nowadays the completion of this school is the base for many apprenticeships and the pupils can also continue their studies at a Gymnasium that is related to a specific field. We have the Gymnasium in our contry, too. This school has the highest level of education and it takes 8 years to complete. After it the pupils can study at an university or a college of higher education. In the Gemeinschaftsschule you can get every completions as the other schools.

      There is a law in Germany which rules the hours of work. This law includes regulations concerning how many hours you are allowed to work during a day and week, how many breaks you have to do during your work, how much overtime you might accumulate during a certain period of time and concerning nightshift, working on Sundays and bank holidays. There are some people who think of this law as unnecessary, but there are other who feel that it protects them from to high demands at work. This law says among other things that you are not allowed to work more than ten hours a day. Sometimes the pressure at work is so high that it is difficult to finish all your work without exceeding the ten hours. Since your boss is liable for not making sure that every employer in his team complys with this rule he can even go to jail if he does not take care of this rule. On the other hand many bosses do want their subordinates to complete certain tasks even if they have to work more than ten hours. Many employers want to please their boss and therefore clock out and then start working again.%% Other employers refer to this law and stay within this timeframe.

      In Germany like in other parts of the western world, gender roles have changed tremdendously over the past decades after WWII. Has it been unimaginable 60 years ago, nowadays women go to work, earn their own living, make careers and fill managerial positions in economy and politics. Female prime ministers such as Margeret Thatcher and Angela Merkel are striking examples for how far women are able to assert themselves in today''s society. On the other hand, males undertake more and more traditional, 'female' duties such as doing housework, cooking and raising children. The gender seems to not play a role any longer in terms of self determination and individual fulfilment. However, can you speak of gender equality and equal opportunities for both males and females in the western society? Rather not. Research regularly shows that women are likely to earn less than men despite doing the same work. On top of that, leading positions are in fact more often filled by men than women. Moving forward, there will be the question, whether those differences between males and females will disappear as well sometime.
    ","Has it been unimaginable 60 years ago , nowadays women go to work , earn their own living , make careers and fill managerial positions in economy and politics ."

      In my country manners are mostly as in every other part of the world.  The most frequent meal is an &quot;asado&quot; (kind of a barbacue -not the same) and when you are invited the best choice is always to bring along with you a nice bottle of red wine. Not too expensive... neither too cheap! Then, it is polite to invite the former host to your own house for an &quot;asado&quot;. Is a good way to say &quot;it was very nice of you have invited me in the first place and I have had a woderful time there&quot;. Another important thing, for the &quot;asador&quot; (cheff) is to cook the meat taking into account likes and dislikes of people.. so you should ask &quot;How do you like the meat? rare, medium or well done?&quot;. Satisfying all the guests should be the challenge of every host and of course this does not apply to &quot;asados&quot; only.

That is such a anxiety atmosphere in each office. It is not good for the health and not good for the moral in office. And the vacations are so quick over.

      The roles have definitely changed but not at all. I think it is the same situation as in this article. Somestimes the women like the old fashioned exorbitant politeness, sometimes they they are too emancipated to accept these behaviour. In our country the politicians are discussing to regulte by law how many woman has to be in the bord of companies etc. For sure everything will become much better if the state will regulate it. The roles has changed because we have a steady rise in living standard, and to fulfill all the desires for luxury goods, a family is in need of a double income. An in the daily working routine the women has had to become more and more independent.

      Alt the beginning of the meeting the CEO said that there are a lot of challenges we have to face in the upcoming year. Theres a problem with the communication between our company and the company we merged with last year. We decided to make some team building exercises together. Another point on the agenda was the budget problems we have. The CFO mentioned that we can't pay any bonuses this Year. With this decision nobody was really happy with. Some thought that the people might be less motivated without the money. At the end the CEO said that he will think about the possibilities and mentioned that the team building exercise might also not be possible without extra money. He will schedule another meeting next week.

      It happened in January at the annual sales meeting. We met in Monte Carlo, a really nice place. The hotel was located between the coast and the casino and the restaurant where we took our meals had a spectacular view to the sea. The agenda was very tough. Three days long we met from 7 am until 8 pm. The CEO came over  from the US and of course our attandance for the hole meeting was mandatory! Every evening was organised. So the location was awesome but there was no time left for sight seeing, shopping or even swimming in the hotel pool. Sometimes it wasn''t so interesting to hear about problems or challenges of products you don''t know. So some colleagues took the chance to buy something for their children, when the agenda said that it was a session of another unit. Then it happened! The CEO changed the agenda and announced a special award to Susan. But Susan wasn''t in the room!  After a few seconds everybody recognized what happened. You could hear a needle drop. It was awkward! An hour later Susan came back into the room and everybody looked at her. At the end she didn''t get the award but a written warning.%%

      Is gender equality important? What is equality? There are certainly differences between men and women. No doubt. There are differences in abilities - but there should be no differences in rights or let's say possibilities to achieve a leading role in the society. In Germany as every else, society is divided in different spheres of life. In german politics women seems to be nearly overrepresented. The impression could arise that the decision makers are mainly women. One of the most famous representative is the german chancellor Angela Merkel. But she is no on her own. She established a group of female politicians around her influencing the political world in Berlin. The role of women in business is still weaker. But the reason is not the glassy ceiling created by men. Sometimes it seems to me that the glassy ceiling was built by women theirselfes.

      Time Management Are you sometimes in trouble with you schedule? Is it difficult for you to decide which task to do next. This text will give you some hints how to improve your time management in order to avoid such problems. First off all you should write down all tasks on a to-do-list you have to manage. Then you have to decide whether the tasks are important or unimportent and if they are time-critical. That means, that you divide the tasks in four categories which are here ordered by their priority: Important and urgent, unimportant and urgent, important and not time-critical, and unimportant and not time-critical. When you chose a task, you should always start with the important and urgent ones. Regarding the unimportant tasks you need to decide, whether you want to get them done, or not and perhaps delegate them to someone else. The next step is to do the unimportant and urgent tasks you decided to do, then the important not time-critical tasks, and if there's still time left you can also finish the unimportant, not time-critical tasks. After each task don't forget to tick it on your to-do-list.%%

      Are in Germany all gender differences eliminated, in view of the facts that we have a woman chancellor, a woman as Defense Secretary and so on? Right is that many things have changed since 1949 when the Federal Republic of Germany was established. The parliamentary Conference, which worked out the Basic Law of Germany, consisted of 65 people only 4 of them were women. Until 1977 German wives had to ask her husband if they had the wish to work for money in a company. Equal paying isn't realized up to now. Child eduction most is accomplished by women. This fact break up the career. The consequence is men can make easier career and earn much more money. Thats the reality for many women in Germany although we have a woman as chancellor.

      In my eyes there are too much TV channels into Germany. Only the pay TV channels are without commercials. The non-pay TV channels have in the night a lot of sex commercials. Then channels have commercials between movies, documentations or comedy it''s impossible to record the broadcast. In my opinion better to pay for channels so you have a cinema feeling and you can enjoy it. Sometimes the commercials are very funny. I like the commercials from Kinderschokolade. It''s a very great idea with a very good jingle.

      I listened the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. The composition is very interesting. Josh Woodward used a different style in this song. The artist use an older style American folk with a pleasant guitar work.  Its a lighter, original and professional song with enjoyable melody for most of the listeners. His voice is rough and edgy. The unhappy lyrics, protesting against the Americas consumer society, may have been influenced for the songwriter hometown: a small town with a lot of changes that not improved their lives. I like this kind of music. I''m a fan from country and folk music with a (political) background. Thats the reason that I can fully recommend it.

      How to behave correctly during working lunch? Basically, understanding and courtesy are the best conditions, to move oneself safely on professional flooring. Working lunches are an important tool in business. When it comes to cutlery, the soup spoon is generally on the right, to the outside of the knife, the fork is on the left and the dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. When cutlery works you look from the outside to the inward. For each course you take a knife and fork again. Once absorbed, the cutlery should not touch the tablecloth. If you want to store it during the meal: always on the plate with it. Is there any gear other drink, you use the glasses from right to left. The water glass stands at the far right. Long-stemmed glasses are to grasp the handle. Before you drink, pat his mouth with the napkin, that you have placed on your knees. Good luck and enjoy your meal.

      I am from Uzbekistan. It was a part of the USSR. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was asserted a very conservative social norms in regard to acceptable gender roles. On that days women faced with unemployment. They had to cater to husband's needs, clean the house and look after the children. Nowadays in some rural ares men still control wives, but in the city things are going better. Females can even reach a high position during career. I think that gender equality is really important.

      When you want to study in Germany, you have to write examinations in the subjects you studied after every semester.  So you can collect credits. You need a special number of credits to get the Bachelor and you need more credits when you want to continue your study for the master degree. Usually you study three years for the Bachelor, but a lot of students go one year abroad to get more experience. Sometimes the students have to earn money, because the flats in big cities are very expensive. Therfore it's usual, that they study longer than 3 years.

Nothing too expensive. Just a little think that shows you are awarding the invitation. - Don't interrupt other guest or the host all the time. Sometimes it's good more to listen than to speak.

      Recently the laws of smoking in public places have been changed in my country. In the past, you could smoke in any place you would like to smoke. Even in offices and restaurants it was legal to smoke cigarettes and you haven't had to pay a fee. Nowadays the laws are much stricter, also according to safety at work. It is not permitted to smoke in restaurants, offices or trains. Also you are just allowed to smoke in marked areas at trainsstations or in seperate rooms in bars. Everyone knows that smoking, even passiv smoking is unhealthy and can cause cancer. I think the government did the right think to change the law, thus the people at work, for example waiters, are protected from toxic cigarette smoke.

      Dear Elizabeth, Id like to thank you for your great job searching the pictures and creating fitting slogans. We discussed your proposals intensely and decided for the third one: Your glamour; your Century. Thats the point. Our target group is glamorous and loves an expensive and luxurious live-style. People rely on our quality and timeless design that made our brand one of the most popular in the group of high performers as recent results of our surveys show. The smart and sovereign smiling lady expresses the feeling of being different, of being at the top. The first picture is quite beautiful but does not really meet our needs and does not support our brand image appropriately, because it is far too universal. The second approach is interesting but only addresses a small range of our target group. We should consider a separate campaign in media used by golfers such as magazines and specialized stores later. Please go on working out a layout for a full page advertisement and a corresponding poster. I look forward to receiving your proposals. See you Ole

      in Germany men and women have equal rights. In reality there a lot differences though. for instance women are mostly responsible for upbringing of the children and for the household. They can make a career, but most very high positions are taken by men. The development of public education for children under 3 years will surely help to improve the situation. But is it realy necassary to blure the differences between the gender. Aren't these difference very attrective too?

      In my company office politics is an important issue. Sometimes the employees are envious to another and look with suspicion to the actions of the others. Their talents are different and obviously with good office politic you can make them more comfortable. Since we have meetings on a regular basis, the employees have the oportunity to get to know each other better. In reverse they listen to the problems of every member and try to solve problems together. This leads to more tolerance and acceptance . My part is to encourage everyone to speak frankly without any fears. We developed strategies to take critisism not as an personal assault but for an helpfull advice. Sometimes it doesn't work well because there are some sensibilities and you need to be very respectful and empathetic not to insult or humiliate a person in front of the group. Nevertheless in the meantime the athmosphere became more and more friendly and solidary.

      In my homecity, which is named Hamburg, there are no real skycrapers. In Hamburg you will only find a few buildings that are higher than 200m. That is because Hamburg is located near the river Elbe. Therefore the ground is wet and it is not possible to build very high buildings. The highest building in hamburg is the old TV tower near the Dammtor trainstation. The tower is not used to broadcast the TV signal anymore, but it has many antennas on its top. Nowadays these antennas are used to broadcast the signal for cell phones. The TV tower is some 400m high and there used to be a restaurant located at the top floor. But the restaurant had to close approximately 15 years ago because of fire safety regulations. The tower is just too high for the firemen to save anyone in the case of an emergency.
