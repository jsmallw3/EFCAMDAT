      There was a theft in my district last week. Thieves broke into an Italian restaurant on Saturday evening. The owner reported that the thieves did not take anything except 2 bottles of Coke. Everyone thought that it was strange. Two days later, the owner remembered that he himself broke in and took them when he was drunk. It was really funny.

      Barcelona is one of my favorite cities. Is on the coaste of Mediterranean Sea, in the north east of Spain. Distance from Moscow to Barcelona is about 3700 km. Barcelona ?are three or four nice beaches and the port. On the opposite side of the city there is a mountain Tibidabo. There is a zoo and lovely parks.I love the Park Guell and Gaudi buildings. People in Barcelona are very beautiful. Even tourists. Barcelona makes people are happy. I can write about this city for a long time.
