Since May 2007 the trend of N.F.S. decreased to steadily to 1,7 M. The International sales figures(I.F.S.) shows different trend. Between 2004 and June 2005 is shown a positive trend, the I.F.S. rose from zero to 2,5 M, this is the peak. Since June 2005 the I.F.S. trend dropped steeply from 2,5M to 0.8 M.

I don't say that is not a serious problem. I can't imagine how you feel into an enclosed space: anxiety, panic, breathing problems, sweating. And I'm sure you feel ridiculous and annoyed with yourself. Everything from work to leisure is conditioned by your phobia. But you must overcome it. A number of treatments and techniques are avaible to dealing with claustrophobia. You should practice a Cognitive Behavior Therapy that teaches some techniques to calm you in a panic attack. Otherwise you can ask a drug treatment. But I think that the first is better for you. You are a brave man and you can learn to live with your fears to overcome them. Kisses F.

      Iron man. Not only a science fiction and action movie but a little masterpiece. Sometimes it happens, working with excellent raw materials, that a movie conceived to be exclusively entertaining, becomes a little masterpiece. Here we have, as more and more often it happens in our time, a movie drawn by a cartoon. We could and should ask ourselves what's hidden behind this strange fact. Why the cartoon world and the real world are so similar in our time? Actually they are so similar to be able to be replaced the one by the other. Anyway, why is Ironman a little masterpiece? Here we have a group of actors and a director deeply inspired so that the result of their work is by far greater than the parts! It's always a blockbuster with the predictable great action, great special effects, inspiring sound-track ....but we also get a man becoming better than he was, the evil defeated, a subtle lovestory floating over there... In a nutshell we have something worth to be seen.

      We are facing two demographic categories. These two demographic categories are our potential customers. We use the data that we obtained from the research and development office. Now we will describe these two main groups. The first group consists of women  between 15 and 19 years, of which almost one third buy at least one magazine a month. In addition, two thirds of these young women prefer magazines to blogs. Seems like a pretty interesting customer base. Instead, the other group is made up of young men between 18 and 24 years. Among these, almost 50% buy the magazine at least one  month and 72% prefer magazines with web content. We could then develop two types of magazines. The first magazine would fight against six competitors, the second would face competition from three rivals, including 1 long-term. Furthermore, the market's first magazine will expand in the future, unlike that of the second will remain constant. From this preliminary analysis I propose to enter in the market of the first magazine.

      I would like to help you in finding some ways to spend less money than that you actually are spending. First of all, I would advice you to cut the expenses on food. I think you could take breakfast at home and to limit breakfast at bar just for the weekend. For the lunch, I would suggest you to prepare something at home, and then carry it to the office into a lunch bag. Moreover, you could reduce your dinner at the restaurant, for example at once or twice per month. In the other evenings your friends and you could decide to organize dinners in your houses, sharing the expenses among you. Otherwise, if you are too tired to prepare dinner, you can always decide to meet them directly after dinner, going outside just for a drink. '' In addition, if your workplace is not too far from your house, I would suggest you to go to the office by feet or by bicycle, in order to save the money spent for the car fuel. Is it is not possible, you could choose the bus, or other public way of transport. These are the cheapest and the greenest ways to afford the movements.

      Hi Ian! How're you doing? I've just heard about your decision to leave your job because of your claustrophobia. I'll be very sad to miss such an experienced colleague.

Nowadays a number of treatments and tecniques are availiable for dealing with claustrophobia, so you don't have to let it controll your life. You could look for a medical help and learn some methods for dealing with the symptoms of your phobia. I red about the CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), a therapy that train the patient's mind towards a more positive and rational way of thinking, so that they no longer feels anxious about enclosed spaces. We could meet for a coffee and talk about it, if you want. What about Thursday evening? Bye now, Claudia

Problems that seemed to be so far away from us now are becoming very common and so we must make some changes to face them. The very first change we need to make is about our daily alimentary habits. You wrote me that food was the main feature in your life every day since breakfast till dinner, so it would be better make some changes. For example you might start having your breakfast at home with a little cup of coffe made using a moka, a glass of cheap milk or a cup of tea. About lunch, you could eat something cheap and healthy like a vegetable salad and some fruit. As last thing, I think you must rinunce at your dinners at restaurants. Why don't you have more cheaper and easier dinners at home with your friends? You will see, with all these little changes you will able to save much money.

The song is a protest song, it has a full arrangement, not only guitar and singer. The theme is consumer society, building and rebuilding don't improve our lives. The point is that sometimes we would rather not change things: natural, older things are often better than the new. The lyrics are not happy, the words are about a negative issue but music is uplifting. This contrast make the song enjoyable. Fans of Woodward will appreciate this song, it has the property of relaxing whithout forgetting the social problems.

      Josh Woodward is an American folk songwriter.  Home improvement is a protest song regarding the modern consumer society. It makes a point about the progress that sometimes destroy good things and is not the recipe for the happiness. The song is very pleasant despite the lyrics is about a subject of protest. Is very simple with a guitar and drum base. The style is a smooth pop sound. Frankly speaking I didnt know this singer but I really enjoyed the song. I will look for the other albums in order to know better this author. Definitely I recommend this singer.

      Life in 20 years Everyone wonders how the future will be. Will there be flying cars, telebeaming, GPS autopilots and robots which will make our lifes easier? What about other artificial intelligences? A.I. is in the running to become reality. Technology has made a great leap forward in the last century, a lot of researches have been done and developed. Ten years ago we phoned our friends, now we tweed or whatsApp them. Instead of writing letters we are facebooking. An average person sits in front of his laptop, tablet or pc about 10 to 12 hours a day. Telecomunication is a sector that forged ahead in the last few years. Experts predict that satellite phones are bound to be popular in the near future and will be used most likely by nearly everyone. I think technology is great but were loosing an important part of human relations, we are humans and we need real friendships not only virtual. On the one hand it is great fun, but on the other hand we need to interact with other people. I think in 20 years itll get worse and we are predistinated to loneliness.%% Social networks will be more advanced and well have forgotten how to socialise without pc, laptop and cellphones.

Some families have difficulty to arrive at the end of the month with the salary or with the pension that they receive. Most people were happy just to keep a roof other their heads and food on the table. And the Italian government, doesn't do anything to improve the situation. Can be said that has subsequently worsened the situation, increasing the taxes instead of decreasing her. Is not seen for the next future any improvement.  Some families have had to change residence because the head-family has lost the job, and they didn't have the money to pay the lease or their mortgages.

If you have a mortgage to pay or some other debts the money that remains you for living is pratically nothing. Sometimes it's hard even to keep a roof over our heads or to keep the food on the table.

      In Italy, even in this days and age, table manners are considered important. Even more when you're eating in a formal situation at someone's house. First of all, if you have any special diat requirements, you're expected to advise your hosts in advance. Telling about that at last minute is impolite. Take a small gift as a bottle of wine or flowers or chocolates are accettable. No expensive gift, these could embarrass your hosts. Wait until your hosts begin eating, you' ll appear very kind. Don't make phone calls or using any devices while you' re at the dinner table, it's considered bad manners. It's crucial using corrently cutlery, The soup spoon is generally on the extreme right, after the knife, the fork is on the left and the dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. However, if you' re not sure which of the silverware to use, whatch what others do, and do that. Crosses the fingers and enjoy your meal.

I think there are few people being bad by far, and there are few people being absolutely nice.  We can have bad people that behave well and good people that involve badly. Behaviour often depends on the situations. After this premise I would like to tell about my co-worker. Shes a reliable and a sociable person.

Shes always there when you need her, and you can always count on her.%% Sometimes shes too much discreet and she doesn't express her opinion.

      A sample of people answered the question about computers in the classroom: 78% stated technology helps students learn and only 12% that students could be hindered by computers or other technological devilries. It was ten years ago and nowadays computers, LIM, tablets and other technological devilries are a widespread and necessary reality, and, why not?, a pleasant and amusing one. The question is obviously extensible to multiple aspects of life, to our daily existence, even if we affirm we are not interested in technology or unable of it. Lets think to our houses, stores (not necessarily superstores) where we have our purchases, transports, communication, whatever public or private office where we work or we get through for bureaucratic matters: everything, in each hour of our days, is mixed with technology. And what will happen in the future? How will be our life in 25 years? Technology will most likely be our self-same life and we are bound to have an absolute dependance on it. We dont stand a change.

      In Italy, there are a lot of good schools and universities. To enter in each university you need to pass the enter test. Usually it's a written test. Now here, the trend is to give tests to students more often. I agree with this, because it's a good proof to test the students preparation. Another important trend is the rising costs. In fact, University is more expensive then once. Finally,another trend is for older people to take college courses. Nowadays it's normal to see a 60-year-old going back to school. It's not surprising and I support because people must never stop to learn.

To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office whit a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as mich as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go uot of my to buy green products, but will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products .

      In Italy we have three level of instruction: elementary school, middle school and secondary school. The students attend school for 13 years and then they can go to university. The teaching method is more analytic and descriptive than critical and in my opinion student are well prepared but they are not skilled enought in dialectical approach. In secondary school students have a lot of home work and a once a month they have a oral and written checks aimed at evaluate the learning. Isn't unusual found professor that use also the group work to enhance the interpersonal skills, especially in the middle school. Unfortunately in the south of Italy the situation is quite different and the PISA test, the international test to evaluate the performances of national instruction system, underline that the score of the north is better than the score in the south.

      Is difficult to judge what ever it is polite or not because it depends heavily on customs and traditions specific to each culture. A good way to tell if a behavior is just being polite in putting in place of the person who is in front of you and ask yourself if what you're doing can bother you. In Western culture, there are certain rules of conduct generally accepted by all. How to behave at the table, for example, has been abundantly discussed in the literature since the seventeenth century. Nowadays some rules of table manners are accepted and respected by all. For example, before you sit down at the table should wash your hands, you should not start eating before the host, you should not talk with your mouth full of food, you should clean your mouth before drinking to avoid leaving traces on the glass, you should not pour wine with the arm upside down, don't make phone calls or send sms while you are at the table and so on.

      I'm the Financial and Administration Manager of a medium Company. My work is hectic and demanding, so I experience an extreme amount of stress. Sometimes I feel like I have no social life because I work so much. Im a single woman and I live in a small flat. Although I dont live from paycheck to paycheck I have my expenses, such as the mortgage, insurance, school etc. Ive got everything I need and maybe more. Im active and have no money worries, but sometimes when I think about myself and my life in general I realized theres something missing. Im not sure where I want to be in life, I dont want to give up, but its getting harder. I would like to have my own family but I know very well that unfortunately this is not the right time, especially in this crisis time. However, I feel like I live a pretty good life overall. I'm happy, and I shouldn't complain.

      The Boi Gordo Churrascaria is my favorite restaurant. They serve authentic Brasilian food. The price is very low, only 17. The appetizers is free and you can get it on the buffet's table. Their speciality is meat, they serve it on a sword and cut it directly on your table. Is fantastic. Their dessert speciality is Pineapple with cinnamon but there is a great selection of classic dessert: Tiramisu, chocolate cake, fresh strawberries with lemon...

      The Italians start their education at age 5 or 6, in elementary school. Then they graduate to middle school, and finally high school. Grades 1 through 5 are usually elementary school, grades 6 through 8 middle school, and grades 9 through 13 high school. After high school, students usually go to a university where they earn a three year degree. Then they can decide to earn a specialist degree, to have a master or to look for a job. Also in Italy there are private or public schools and universities. Generally there is the opinion that private schools are easier than publics, but it's not true for universities.

      I feel strongly that there are to many violence and transgressive advertising on TV in Italy. At any time, you can see horror film or action film with fighting or war. I think that these programme TV there should be only in the evening and from 11 pm onwards. In my opinion we need to stop watching these violent programs and demand more educational ones. Moreover I feel strongly that the rating system doesn't always help, because there is no difference between a rating &quot;yellow light and red light&quot;. Sometimes the programme is classified with &quot;yellow light&quot; instead there are too much violence or sex and the programme could be classified &quot;red light&quot; (only for adults). We need to ask for more restrictions on them.

      Nowadays the issue of CSR is much more difficult to deal with rather than it was in the past, because the impact corporations have on the environment and community can make the difference. In the twenty-first century we can't dny that natural resources are running out, but we keep on exploiting them without caring too much about it. For some companies CSR is undoubtably a marketing device, to get more visibility in the world of business, in order to rise their income. On the contrary, for some others CSR is considered a waste of money and they prefer conveying their attention to shareholders. I think that now we can no longer have such a careless attitude , above all if we consider that we're living in a global community, where each action has an effect on all the other components, wherever they are in the world! Every person in the world should think about this: what can I do to improve life of others, in addition to mine?

      Personally I have never been too favorable to the opening of large shopping centers. First of all, they have a great impact on the environment occupying large areas close to urban centers. In my city, a big shopping center has closed for the competition caused by other centers and for years the whole area is in ruins since it was not possible to allocate them to other activities. Is it true that the large shopping malls create jobs but impoverished city centers where small businesses are forced to close. Workers employed in a big-box store are often underpaid when you consider the pace of work and hours of opening. In recent years all the great centers shopping malls are open also 14 hours a day and remain open during all weekends and holidays. A positive aspect of the spread of shopping malls is in the quality and freshness of the food. Being subject to greater and more frequent inspections by the health authorities, I think they have more attention to the foods sold.

      In Italy etiquette is very important at dinner and in many other occasions. A surely important thing is dressing appropriately to the event you are attending. Speaking of table manners, when you are invited to dine at another's house you should not exceed ten minutes of delay nor arrive early, this could be either way annoying to your host. It is appropriate to bring a little present to your host, often a pack of sweets or a bottle of wine. There are many common etiquette tips to be respected, like waiting for the host to start the eating, using cutlery properly, leaving politely the seat if you recieve an impotant call. Is quite unpolite to leave you phone lying on the table or to answer sms interrupting visual contact with your speakers. Although eating customs vary quite a bit from place to place, in my place is considered very unpleasant to the host, expecially who cooked the meal, not to finish your deal; al least you should have a good try of all the stuff offered even if you are full. When an encore of a dish is offered to you, better be honest on your intentions, either not beeing esitant if you wish to eat or politely discarding if you are full.%% This is related only to an informal and familiar context however.

      In general, green business is important to me but if I have to do something for this it became more complicate. If you want to enter in a green business you must have a lot of energy and to know how to invest your capital. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in thieir producuts and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neightborthood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Saint Roccos festival last for three days. Its in August in Palagiano in South Italy where I was born. Its a suggestive party where you can see a parade with some horses. Some children ride the horses like Saint Rocco did it. The streets are lighting by fun colors light and a lot of shops sell your good on the street. Many people walk on the crowded street while the beautiful music sounds in the town. At night therere fantastic firework. I prefer to tell about my better travel. I visited Rowaniemi in Finland and I saw Santa Claus. It was winter and the temperatures was until -38'C. I was fashination about the colours of ice and snow. I think that the colors of the cold are the best colors that you can see in the world. The three and landscape covered by snow was sublime! My most important travel was in USA. I and some friends (not true friends, but companios of Adventure in the World, do you know it?) drove from Los Angeles to NY for about 12000 Km in 30 days.

The movie is made in 1990 and was directed by Chris Columbus. Home alone is a comedy. The story is around three characters: a child who stay alone at home for Christmas because their parents are a bit careless. They fly to Paris without their son Kevin played by Macaulay Culkin; other characters are two thieves, which will have to fight with a Kevin. The fight is very funny. My son enjoyed the movie. I think the thieves are key to success. This two characters was played very well.

Only one month after my degree in Architecture, I found a job as architect for a quite big company in Rome. Subsequently, italian economy, building market and kinds of contract suggested me to change job. Fortunately it was a good move because of crisis and paralysis of money. That company for which I worked, is not in fine waters now. It isn't a good moment for global economy but above all for the italian state. Almost all economic fields have fallen down due to wrong politics and corruption. Every employee has affected by economic difficulties. I have decided to choose an other job as my main source of income. I work as architect only in my spare time, like an additional option. In this historic period to find enough money working in building market it is an impossible thing. Hopes for the future are that global economy turn around and our political figures are going to change the work laws, in order to get better all our lifes.

This field of study is continuously changed in the last decades, reflecting the deep impact of new technologies on the contemporary lifestyles. So, my life reflects my studies: every day more rarely I buy the newspaper and I usually read information by on-line canals. Only twenty years ago I couldnt know the meaning of email and it was impossible to imagine the disappearance of paper letters and postcards, for example. Nowadays almost all I read pass through the screens of my smartphone and my computer. My reading habit are totally changed. On one hand, certainly this is a loss for romantic images of books, libraries and old letters; on the other hand, this is a good point for the environment, considering the quantity of paper that I can save now.

      I think that the winning strategy for all companies is to create a strong teamwork made of capable people in their respective sectors. Is also important to create the right feeling, for example: to have a meeting every weeks where everyone can bring own contribution and ideas, to listen and debate with the other components of the team, to set up relations and friendship, etc. I think also is a good idea to reward the teamwork with benefits and salary increases when the goals that had set out are achieved. For each important goal reached it could organize a party to celebrate the event and socialize even further. If some business goals aren't reach, a good manager must understand the strategy weakness and the causes of failure - if the problem is the teamwork or someone into the team, the manager have to be so strong to take hard decisions until to change or lay off some components of the teamwork. Ultimately, I think the best strategy to manage every specific issue is to choose the best employees, expert in the specific sectors.

      What is green business for me? That's a difficult question. If I think about food, I would say &quot;green&quot; products must be produced locally, using only natural elements, without additives, with low transportation costs, and therefore respecting the environment. The package of green products should be biodegradable or reusable for many times or recyclable. If I think about detergents or clothes or material in general, I would say &quot;green&quot; products must be made of natural substances, must be good for our health and don't damage the environment. Sometimes it's difficult to get all the information you'd need to recognize real green products or to be sure there are clear differences with other products. I must say that I don't always buy 2green&quot; products, I pay more attention in choosing products of a known brand, of companies which I know have a good reputation and are known for their attention to Social Corporate responsibility. Often infact &quot;green&quot; products are expensive and you are not sure if they really are &quot;green&quot;.

      Solar power. Our country benefits of a favourable weather: mostly sunny, with acceptable temperatures also in winter. That's the reason why I can easily say that solar power would be the most effective form of renewable energy for our city. Energy from the sun, thanks to solar panels that can absorb solar energy from sun's rays, can get converted into thermal or electrical energy . I suggest to install high quality solar panels: it'll be expensive but it'll be an investment for our future and the future of our children. We will face also quite high maintenance costs (cleaning, short circuits, cracks, corrosion) and the city will pay most of the money, about $120,000. As far I'm concerned we will demonstrate in few months the advantages of using solar power: we'll also attract turists that will help the growth of our economy. Thanks a lot for your attention.

      There are many ways to implement an effective and efficient management. The number one thing is to be clear and honest with your colleagues and subordinates about your objectives and the way you want to accomplish your mission: this will empower you because they will share your decisions and be committed to their work. Always remember to communicate with others in a very clear way and for that reason the way you will organize your meetings will be very important: the meetings are useful to set milestones for your projects and discuss with your co-workers about the best way to reach their goals, no room for vagueness and no-sense words. Remember that the key for a good efficiency in a globalised world with a cut-throat competition is know-how: the first commandment of a manager's religions is that knowledge is power, the more efforts you put on on it the more the results you get. Good management skills are reached through time and training, sharing ideas with others and having a good culture is fundamental. The way you express yourself will be very important during your meetings, this will give you charisma.

      Yesterday, there was a theft in my building. Thieves broke into an apartment and stole about 1.000. The apartment owner, a old man that live alone, was out for shopping and the thieves hadn't no problem to take the money and run away. The police is working to identify the thieves but it's no easy because nobody saw them.

      It's very difficult to pinpoint what defines success. The success too depends on the person, on his/her aspirations in the life. I think that successful people have reached their goals in the life, whatever their goal is. Doesn't matter whether I'm CEO of a big international company or I'm a waiter in a bar, success comes first of all from inside. What makes a successful person? I think that first of all, a successful person should be modest. He doesn't have to go around saying 'Look, admire me, I'm a successful person'. Moreover, he must be passionate for his work. He must love his work. He must be creative and ambitious too. Even when he reaches success, he doesn't have to stop to be ambitious, because I think that ambition is the best engine if you want to be the best and to go on with your life. He should be resilient and proactive, too. Proactive means that the person is able to predict and prevent future problems. If the problem arrives, a resilient person is able to face it and to bounce it back. It's very difficult to find all in the same person, of course!%%

      In my country work' style is very different in various regions. In the North there are many people who work very strong, perhaps too much. They are rich, but also very stressed out. They are angry everytime against the people from the Sud, because they say that the southern people are &quot;fannulloni&quot;, it means very lazy. The Northern people say also that the Southern people get their life on the shoulders of the Welfare. The northern people wanted not pay the taxes to the Italian State, but take these to rest in their regions. Is very difficult be reasonable. All have some reason. The northern people should work less, and the southern people sholud work more.

      In my country in the year 1946 women have obtained the right to vote and they have immediately exercised in the same year.In the year 1978 the women have won their battle on the right to abortion . Generally ,women work hard but despite this they receive a lower salary than males .Gradually this difference is disappearing but it will take time. Is very difficult for women to reach places of responsibility of a certain level .Maybe the causes can be : - If a child is sick they might stay at home to treat him . - Each month they are sick for a week . - When they are in maternity ,they'll receive a salary for almost one year .Those things may put the women in the minority with the men . I am convinced about the importance of gender equality, but the big companies not yet.

      Maybe women overcame the male gender? Is possible that in a few years women may reach places now reserved only a men . Nowadays women study more than males and so more skills means more work opportunity and, above all, places with more responsability and power. Now men don't realise this change in the society and when they will get this in their mind, for me, it could rise a little battle of gender because surely women don't will leave their achievements.I hope and believe that at this point genders male and female will become allies understanding the need of both.

      Dear friend, How you know, my country is going through a deep crisis (unfortunately as many several European countries): many enterprises have stopped their activity, unemployment is at high level - especially among youth and over fifty  and GDP is negative or flat since many years. Is time to react! So, I hope well be able to tap into our culture to renew our society and make it more accountable, more efficient and more equitable. I know that wont be easy, because the needed changes are wide and deep, and concerns all social categories, but I think (or maybe I hope) well be able to do it. My dream is also that our young people do not have more to go abroad for a better future. Times may change... Fabio

      In Italy colleges dont give many tests to students. Im for do short tests very often, because it can help to understand your problems. If you do only few tests, they become very important and, if you fail them, you could fail the grade. Not many older people take college courses, but is a trend to take special classes just for them. I dont support this Idea, because it sounds like not normal classes. Im 57 now and maybe in few years Id also go back to school, but it will have to be a normal college course.

      After listening to the song Home Improvement by Josh Woodwart, I wish to dont listen it anymore. I think that it is a very simple folk-rock tune and really very trite. Is something that you can hear without listening to, because it doesnt catch the attention. The topic of the song is old but always actual, but the lyrics is not interesting. It doesnt  say anything realy edgy. It seems more like a nostalgic tale of the lost world. The Joshs voice is a kind of sweet, not rough, so he doesnt seems really mad for what is happening. The mood of the song is kind of resigned but with a quick bet and this also I dont like. Definitely I dont recommend you this  song.
