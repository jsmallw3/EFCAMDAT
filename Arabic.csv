I believe that owning a house is cheaper than renting, at least each month when I deposit the loan installment I will increase my saving as step to be an owner to a valuable property instead of I give it to the landlord. More over I will feel free to change my house decore and I can live as I want according to my mood and tast. Please find enclosed budget outline, I paid $1000 for rent per month, my income is $5000, so I can offer $2000 for mortgage per month. Is it possible to offer the installment every two months and if yes, Is the interest will be lower. At last as you see will I be able to apply for a loan? I look forward to hearing from you.

      Vix N. So you think you can sing? My target today is well-known rapper for the past 3 years which makes it even more interesting. How did she manage to stay on top of the female rapper list for these three years? Right now its all in the past. If you ask me her career is in decline and she is definitely a B-list material these days. Even her fans think something is wrong with the whole attitude of hers. But lets focus on her greater cause. Vix is a spokesperson for National Organization for Addicts In the Music Industry (NO-AMI). Isnt it just nice  former addict is raising awareness about her own problems? Did you know that Vix had been an addict for alcohol and drugs for 10 years? As they say there are no former addicts. She allegedly fell of the wagon last year. Weeks spent in rehabilitation clinics dont do o lot of good for your public image, do they? Lets pretend it never happened.

      One day, Meg was going out to work as usual time in the morning. It's amazing how gorgeous the morning was until it all happened. As she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, she saw a young couple get out of a car. She was surprised when they began vandalizing the local newsagents. She decided to go over to them to see if she could stop them. Suddenly, the woman pushed the gun into her stomach, and starting talking very fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world. She was terrified she was going to shoot her! After that, she grabbed the laptop off her and ran off down the street. A passer-by chased her and caught her by the hair. Turns out it was a wig, the woman was a teenage boy. They haven't caught the couple yet and she's scared to leave the house.

      Dear Maher, I would like to inform you that , after deep discussion with my Colleagues ,weve selected an ad campaign for Century watches. Im sure youll love our choice of campaigns. Many people think that Century is a classic and well-known brand because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns.In fact, customers prefer Century because its simply the best and most reliable watch maker on the market. Thats the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top three watchmakers worldwide. Considering Centurys trend of working with famous stars, we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign.However ,we decided that the quality of the watch was more important than  celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf, simple and crystal clear but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message.A message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad. Golf and Century. The perfect team is a simple message that everyone can understand. And thats why our ad will succeed and still follow Centurys style.When you consider that our ad will feature a common man playing golf, you might think its the wrong choice. However, the secret of our campaign relies on the fact that this man will still inspire taste and elegance.

I think by far this might be the best salary you could ever get. That's not all. You'll  get full accident insurance, you know, just in case the lion bites your butt. Ha ha, just kidding. And you'll get 1 month holiday every year. The real surprise is that you'll get regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles. wow, that exhilarating!

      Saudi Arabia is an amazing country in spite of it has strange culture as people think. There are millions of muslims visit the holy capital city Makkah because of hajj.

If you want get married you have to ask she and if she accept you have to pay a money for she and you have to protect she and drive instead of she, and pay to what she want!! I swear there isn't a conservative society, preserves the dignity of men and women, and achieve the concept of justice, not equality. AND Allah says on Quran (?????? ?????? ???????? ???? ??? ????????? ?????????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???? ?????? ??????????? ) Alanaam *116* translation: And in case you obey most of whoever are on earth, (Literally: in the earth) they will make you err away from the way of Allah; decidedly they closely follow nothing except surmise, and decidedly they do (nothing) except conjecture.%%

      Really you dont know how a beautiful day could turn out to a terrifying day. It was a beautiful sunny, my friend was going out to work as usual round about eight in the morning.  She went into coffee pot and came out carrying her usual non-fat mocha latte coffee in one hand, her laptop in the other, her handbag over her shoulder. While she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, she saw a young couple get out of car. They left engine running and the stereo playing  talk about noise and air pollution. My friend was surprised when they suddenly began vandalizing the local newsagents. They were breaking window with a hammer, and throwing paint on the store front. My friend didnt know what to do but as a good citizen, she decided to go over to them to see if she could get them to stop.%% Suddenly the young women came at my friend waving a gun!  My friend really gets a good look at that young women- she had very long hair over her eyes and face. She pushed the gun into my friend stomach, and started talking very fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world. My friend was shaking so much and while the young woman was talking so quickly that my friend couldnt understand her. My friend was terrified she was going to shot her, it was just so surprising. After what seemed like a lifetime, but was probably only a few seconds really, the young woman grabbed the laptop off my friend and ran off down the street. A passer-by a nice handsome looking guy chased the young woman and caught her by the hair, which came off in his hands! Turns out it was a wig and the young woman wasnt a young woman at all, but a teenage boy.  They havent caught the couple yet; my friend scared to leave the house and just astounded that a perfect normal day could turn out like this in this town.

      Dear Elizabeth, We've selected an ad campaign for Century watches. I'm sure you'll love our choice of campaigns. Many people think that Century is a classic and well-known brand, because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns. While this might be true, it's also true customers prefer Century because it's simply the best and most reliable watchmaker on the market. Thats the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top watchmakers worldwide. Considering Century's trend of working with famous stars we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign. We decided, however, that the quality of the watch was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a man playing golf. Simple and crystal-clear, but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message; a message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every man that will read and look at our ad.

To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an offic with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging.

It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to by green product.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then i think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging.

      I think that every one can be a leader, the thing is that you should be able to recognize your weaknesses and work hard to maximize your strengths . Of course not everyone is able to figure out his strengths and weaknesses by his own, sometimes your manager or your colleagues can help. In my opinion, honsty is critical when it comes to dealing with staff, successful manager should be truthful and sincere. The other important thing to be  a successful manager is having skills to treat with people, and this includes comunicating with people at different levels in the  exacutive ladder, no matter what theire position is, good manager should take benefit of all staff's new ideas, especially young employees. Being an empathetic person is crucial , because caring of staff's personal needs helps the manager to stay close to employees and cater for them every need , and that in turn will satisfy them and encourges them to work hard. Sometimes it's just confusing to clearly distinguish between what is most important and less critical,  but in general , I believe that honesty and empathy will result in a good team building.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      why there were a gender differences? why the women weren't able to take all there rights at 60's era? there are a lot of questions should be highlighted! We always hear that the man able-bodied is stronger than the woman! is that prime reason why the women jobs were certain! still i think they aren't. we can belongs man to some physical career, but the physical infrastructure will never ever be a handicap for a women to join a life alternative fields at all! Here we can say this point is one of reasons that women appealed for it. Since the 90's era started, women start to take all there rights! women become partitioned part of the community. she won the people's elections for the presidency of the nation council. she got her Phd in medicine, engineering.. ..etc &amp; start compete with a man in all levels. though we can say this ear ably the principle of gender quality! Sine every person is born for a reason, for aim to work, for a goals to reach, there will not be differences between men and women!

      In my country the TV. is more restricted than any other countries because of our religion which restricts watching sex at anytime and any age. Most of the programs are dramas, educational, news, sports and game shows. In my opinion, this is great because we don't need to classify the programs or restrict children from watching TV. and we can leave them in front of it at anytime. I would prefer more documentaries than any other TV programs because of its information which can help people to be more educated.

The plot of the film focus on the role of 911 operators in law enforcement, and the film proved a commercial success, grossing nearly 60 million.

      TV considers one of the things that have a big effect in our daily life. further more ,I believe that the TV is one of the most influential technical achievement the human being has ever invented .for instance.the majority of people getting depend on it as an important source to acquire the knowledge in comparison with the traditional role to books as a genuine source for information. Nowadays Most of TV channels are showing diverse programs.like reality shows,sitcom.movies.news.and documentaries. but,How to dedicate these programs and shows to be useful for us and our children ?referring to this question it is necessary to mention that the parents mustn't let their children watching TV themselves.also the TV  has to show the sex and adult movies lately. Eventually, TV is getting play important role in forming people's consciousness and realization.and because of that the chairmen should oblige the TV owners to fellow directed policy in their broadcasting .
