      Dear Mr. Brown, It will be pleasure for me to host you in Turkey. First of all, please don't hesitate to visit my country. You will be welcomed by Turkish people in a friendly manner. Of course, all the countries in the world have different cultures. Sometimes it may cause some problems. For that reason, I would like to give some clues to you about our culture, because you will encounter these culturel differences while you are in Turkey. Let me explain some gustures and body languages. In Turkey, 'thumbs up' means appriciating someone or something. 'Nodding your head' means approving. If you shake your head from one side to another side, it will mean that you don't aggree or you don't approve. In the bills, service isn't included, so you should give about 10% of the bill as a tip. You will buy a lot of things in Turkey, but please be careful while purchasing something because the sellers want much money from the foreigners. That's why, it will be better for you if you bargain. Yours sincerely, Yurttabir

      I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B is played by James Stewart. L.B is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins usig his camera to fight evi. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful!
