      Seems that you have a money problem because of shopping addiction. Firstly, don't use your credit card to pay your shopping. Use cash only. Think before you will going to byu a new clothes or what ever you are going to buy. Do you really need that? Secondly, why don't you take a friend with you for a shopping?

      I think that smartphone have caused a good things and bad things to my life. Nowadays it's so easy to follow different news sources and read news because I can do it online using my smartphone. This is absolutely good thing. Bad thing is that I read news on my smartphone also then when I am on the park with my kids. I don't think so that this is a good thing because I don't focus to my kids then. But of course this is not my smartphone's fault! of course I can keep a contact with my kids better than earlier because they has smartphones also!

      Laws are built to permit to life peacefully in society. In my opinion rules are necessary but they have to be understandable and legitimate. A large quantity of laws are complex or event unknowns by the public. Moreover, legislations on  my views should be proportionate to the aim. Objectives factors as the probable effect of the regulation or studies on the prohibited or regulated behaviors are necessary to draw a regulation. I think if the legislator want that I apply the law I have to understand that for my safety and security. Road regulation and workplace rules most of times seems grounded and necessary, even if sometimes it's boring and restrictive in daily life.

Tickets cost 60 euros. The festival is nosy because there is live music all the time and a lot of people coming from other cities so streets are crowded.

Such Ideas like this can help only people wish don't want to develop themselves. Ability to think more and to work hard can change life. None devi?es not able to improve the existence. The future of man within him. Only need to feel it.
