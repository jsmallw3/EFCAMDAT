      The author's argument is clear and easy to understand. She lists two very simple steps to for people to choose their right career. Sounds like reasonable and feasible. But in fact it seems very difficult for most people to identify their personality, especially for young people. There are many people who don't know what careers on earth are suitable for them even till they retire. Nonetheless, more or less, maybe the method will be of some help to people. At least if you read the book, it will motivate you to think a bit more about your career before you make a dicision. After all, it's so important for one to seize the best chance, because one only has one chance to come to this world.

Lets look at National Sales Figures first where we can see a steady increase from 0 in 2004 to 1 million in 2005. Then, the sales figures remained the same for 2 years. Again, we can see a dramatic increase in National Sales Figures from 1 million in 2006 to 3 million in 2007, reaching to the top. Finally, the figures showed a sharp fall and then back to 1 million in 2008. Next, International Sales Figures, where we can see a dramatic rise from 0 in 2004 to about 2 million in 2005 and then reached the top between 2005 and 2006. As you can see, the figures was steady in 2006 and 2007, then it showed a sharp fall from 1 million to aroud 0.5 million in 2007. Finally, the figures remained the same until 2008. In conclusion, I would like to say that we should concentrate our efforts in the national market and consolidate the gains we have made there.

It wasted a lot of time. They were promised that the restaurant's food will delicious. Actually, that's awful. They were not see most of animals, just monkeys and birds.

      Dear friends: I am very happp to tell you that LED tube lights are on sale in my shop. That are the very functional lighting in nowadays. LED tube lights can be used not only at home but also hotels and many places which are using the traditional fluorescent tube light. Comparing with the fluorescent tube light, LED tube light can save 50% energy in power consumption, such as it is only cost 18W to get the same brightness as fluorescent tube. But the later should be cost 40W. The usage for a LED tube light is very easy and no need to change any with the traditional light. What you need to do is very easy. Firstly, you need to replace the fluorescent tube light with LED tube light. Secondly, take off the starter which is at the base bottom. The last, turn on the light, you will supprise that LED tube light the same bright and more energy save. You can earn that back in 1 year ( it can be use for 3 years) in the way it save many electric charge. Do not wait any more, call to me by ############ to get some LED tube light.

      If someone throw salt over your shoulder, will you think it's bad luck? My friend Meg did think so. It was a beautifully day and he went out to work as usual. When he was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth with a laptop on his hand, he saw a young couple get out of a car while the engine running and stereo playing. He was so surprised that they began vandalizing the local newsagents with a hammer, and throwing paint on the store front. He decided to stop them. But all of a sudden, the long hair young woman came to him and waving a gun. He was so astonished and terrified. Only a few seconds really, she grabbed the laptop off him and ran off down the street. A passer-by chased her and caught her by the hair. But not before this guy grabbed her hair, it came off in his hand! Turns out it was a wig. And the young woman was actually a teenage boy. It is the most terrifying day of his life.

      Dear Sir, I am writing to ask your advice about a problem I have with my landlord and real estate agent. When I signed the contract there were many problems with the house, such as the lights are't working in many rooms, the plumbing drains are clogged, the sink fills up and water goes everywhere. But at that time my landlord promised me that he would have them fixed. So I trusted him and the estate agency, and moved in, but the problems still haven't solved so far. And now I am planning to move out, but the landlord refuses to give me my deposit back. I know I should have had these problems fixed before I signed the contract, but I really haven't broken or damaged anything during my living, I have written the letter to the estate agency, but he said this problem is between me and the landlord. So please kindly tell me what the consumer protection laws are and what I should do now? Thanks a lot! Best Regards, Angela

      Dear Sir, I am writing to ask your advice about a problem I have with my landlord and real estate agent. When I signed the contract, these problems had already been, and the landlord told me that he would repair them immediately, I trusted him then, so I moved into the house before he repaired them, and till now It had been a long time past the problems had not solved, so I didn't want to bear it, I sent an email to the landlord telling him that I wanted to move out and wanted him give me my deposit, but he replied that he would not give back my deposit, he said the problems of the house were made by me, then I sent an email to the real estate agent and wanted him to deal with this for me, but the agent said this was none of his business. So I want to you give me some advice. Thanks a lot. Your faithfully

The drains of toilet always clogged, water alway filled in sink and overflew. 3. The most important thing is the roof, it always leaking at rain since I had moved into the house. Sometimes it too wet to sleep in the badroom and resulted in I have to living with my friends. It's really ridiculous to landlord refused retrurn my foregift. I hope get advices on legal to treat it.

I want to take this oppertunity to tell you a story my friend Meg experienced. one day, he went to work carrying a laptop as usual round about eight in the morning. when he was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, he wasn't aware a terrible things was happening. Firstly, he saw a young couple get out of a car and began to vandalize the local newsagents. They were breaking the window with a hammer, and throwing paint on the store front . So he decided to go over to them to see if he could get them to stop. Suddenly the young woman who had very long hair came at him waving a gun! He felt very fear that she was going to shoot him. Just at the moment, she grabbed his laptop off him and ran off down the street. Next a passer-by, looking guy he remembered, chased her and caught her by the hair. Somehow she managed to escape. Turns out it was a wig of her hair. The young woman wasn't a young woman at all, but a teenage boy. Finally, they haven't caught the couple yet. You can imagine that is terrible day.

      Hello Tim, Glad to hear from you and know you are OK. My family and I visited to Beijing during the China Spring Festival. After 4 days travel, on the last evening there, the guide took us to a very luxury resturant to have supper. But you know, we can not afford that. So we consulted with the guide if we can choose another resturant, she said yes, but did not give any advice to us. We went out and strolled around the street, after about 30 mintes later, we found a small special resturant, and the introduction says it has the best roasted duck around the Beijing city, so we decided to have a try. After teast, we all felt good and valuable, and we were satisfied there because it was really delicious and have a proper price. When we went back to the touring car, we told our experience to the others, we found that the others spent 5 times the price but just had the same food be ate, so I think, we should not obey all what the guide choosed for us, we can have a try to other way of eat and buy things.

      Dear Sirs, Over a few days, I have spent my whole holiday taking part in the tourist attractions which was provided by your company. Now, I have to tell you that I was all the more shocked by my incredibly disappointing experience. Heres what happened: first, the ship was a horrible, shabby little boat, neither new or a cruise ship, which you mentioned as cruise tour. Whats more, the ship had problems with its engine, can you imagine what is the impact on our safety? Second, the cabin was dirty and full of ants, beds were uncomfortable, bathrooms were also disgusting. Third, the captain was unfriendly and unprofessional, we wasted a lot of time because of his woke up late. Fourth, we didnt see most of the animals you were promised in your advertisement, only eagles. In addition, why was there the extra hidden charges happened? That is totally different from your guarantee. Anyway, I have to say all of these are really disappointed me, and I thought you already got the same complaint from other travelers. For your company, Blue Cruise Alaska has been known as a good reputation in this field. Please contact me as soon as you look into this matter. I would also appreciate receiving the extra charges and some kind of compensation for my trouble. If you have any question, please reach me by email or call me at xxx xxx xxx. Best regards John

But Im still confusing about the detail training content. Heres some information about the employee. Please check it and give your recommends to clarify the course information about that. 1. This is a new employee in our company. Hes been here for about 2 month. He still could not feel comfortable with his team especially when they had different agreements. He thought that he couldnt handle this issue anyway. 2. He could not focus on listening empathetically. Especial when they were discussing some problems which he couldnt understand. 3. He had some time management issues such as meeting deadline issues. We hope you can manage a course for this case to help to improve this employees problems so that he can work better and get better performance in the future. Looking forwards to your reply.

      I heard the gossip that Gavin Taylors wife, Alana. She caught him with another woman. is suing him for divorce. If they divorced shell get millions of dollars. I cant believe it, they got married only year. People always gossip about newly-web couples. There must be some kind of conspiracy going on. Somebody wants Gavin to look bad, either Alana or media. Somebody spread that story around Gavin. Such case usually happened on public people, we may keep our own judgment.

      In China, doctors always give patients prescriptions for antibiotics, because they think it is a general way to cure all diseases. Sometimes doctors can get a commssion for every antibiotics prescription from the sales and the manufacturers. Sometimes patients also require doctors to use antibiotics, because they hope getting better earlier. But they don't know antibiotic resisitance. Nowdays over-prescribing antibiotics is a common phenomenon in China. It's not good for health. Sometimes It's very dangerous, especially for children. The growth of antibiotic-resisitant bacteria has been a chief public health problem. It's very difficult and expensive to cure infections form resistant bacteria. I think the goverment should make more regulations and rules against over-prescribing antibiotics.

      manners were very inportant and restrict in our traditonal culture,we had many specific rules of etiquette.for example, It's  not appropriate to address people by their first names- unless you known them very well. but we never called the elder by their first names even they were your grandparents. when you met someone for the first time,always shaked hands,and most time we met friend ,we didn't hug people ,nor kiss  but  shaked hands . When we have dinner,We always let the elder to sit in the center and the most inportant seat first.the children were always seat in another table to seperate from the aduld. We didn't eat any food with our hands.It's perfectly acceptable to bring gifts if you were invited to someone's house.nomally that a big box of gift with alcohol,or biscult,or cigerette or doll. sometimes it was a bunch of flower.Nowsday ,things have changed a lot.perticularly for young people,they are very relex in any place without any rule.

      Technology is the most common thing existed in the 21st century. Nobody can live without the technology, especially for the young generation. It's really a great invention. I can hear the news from all over the world without going out. I can even sit on the sofa and control all the devices at my home with a remote. I can order any products via the internet. However, technology is a double-edged sword. Sometimes it can be overwhelming. As far as I'm concerned, I'm totally dependent on my smartphone and completely engrossed in mobile phone games. I don't know what to do if I don't hold my phone in my hand. It seems like it has put a curse on me.

      Food security is one of the worst problems in my country. Seems that China government is very focused and has been doing some measures, but food security is still very very serious problem that we're facing. First of all is political corruption. Seldom officials are really care about food security, money is the only thing that they are interested in. More important, the official class has its special food supply system which has nothing to do with folk class. Second, the aggravating environmental exacerbates food security. To change the bad situations, China need to political reform thoroughly, the folk class need to push forward the reform and take their responsibilities. China belongs to all Chinese people, not seldom official class.

      Hi, Annie, At the very beginning of the meeting the CEO pointed out that the company was in a very difficult situation in marketing and the management administration was a mess. The CFO agreed and suggested that the only solution was to hire a active, experienced general manager. Finally, the borad of directors has decied that the companyshould replace the general manager. I think that it is a reasonable decision because the present G.M. is too old to work motivated and it's time for him to retire. At the end of the meeting the directors all agreed that the reason to change G.M. would be age instead of the management. In the meaning time, CEO reminded us that the decsion is confidential untill that the new general manager has been selected and nominated. I'll keep you informed if any progress in this regards.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Last year I experienced my first hurricane. It was incredible. Hurricane warnings were announced for several days, so most people were ready, but I couldnt have imagined what would happen. The wind was blowing like crazy. The city was flooded. There was a lot of destruction. Then, all of sudden, everything was calm. We were in the eye of the hurricane. Thats the centre of the storm. The calm lasted for about 30 minutes, and then wind and the flooding started all over again. No one was killed in the disaster, but many were hospitalized. Ill never forget it.

      I just saw 'Rear Window.' What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors! Soon, L.B. begins using his camera to fight evil. I saw the remake in 1998, but it's not the same. Daryl Hannah's acting was dreadful! (Dear teacher: I don't like watching films.

      Re: Concerning the Sales Figures of the Manbag in Asia and South America. Introductions The report was requested by Mr Samson, to address the softfall in salesof the 'Manbag' in South America. Methodology A cross section of cinsumers in Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai were interviewed to evaluate the reasons for the disparity in sales figures in Asia and South America Findings -Of the 1,000 people interviewed in Shanghai ,80% responded favorably to the design of 'Manbag',but only 55% of the 80% said they would consider buying it .These figures reflect the overall approval ratings in the Asia region . -Of the 1,000 people interviewed in Rio de Janeiro , 35% responded favorably to the design of 'Manbag',and only 20% of the 35% said they would consider buying it . Conclusions -Insufficient research was carried out before the 'Manbag ' was designed and lanched . -There was not enough awareness of the diversity styles and tastes in different parts of the world . Recommendations -More research is required into what men want and need in an accessory. - The findings show that design ,material ,color and size of the 'Manbag 'need rethinking: -1. Design: more sporty -2. Size: slightly bigger -3. Colors: strong primary colors; black and white -4.%% Material: leather

      Nowadays, you can see the NO SMOKING signs almost every public area, especially the closed space. From the perspective of smokers, they are too much! The smokers always complain that theres less and less room for them to smoke. They insist that smoking is their civil right and the others exaggerate the harm of it. In My opinion, these are their excuse because they are too addicted to cigarette. We all know that smoking cigarette can cause serious health condition problem, like lump cancer. We also know that passive smoking, or second-hand smoking might do more harm. So its very clear that there must be rules out there to protect people from nicotine. Theres a trend that more and more place such as: restaurants, coffee shops, meeting room, etc provide a no smoking area as well as a smoking area. Its a very compromising but reasonable plan for both two parties. So why dont we all follow the rules to make our lives safer and easier.

Thieves broke into the museum, stole a painting which was painted by the most popular Chinese painter. The security guard discovered the theft on Sunday morning. The owner of the museum estimated the loss must be up to $200,000. What a pity! I hope police can arrest the criminal as quickly as possible.

      Isn't the time change too quickIn some big morden cities, value even changed more. A wife can be a boss in the family, control the money, make important decisions. Husband maybe poor, need to work and also take housework, give all the money to his wife. There's a saying, man's job is making money, and women's job is spending money.

      In China, the office cultrue differs from region to region. Also the management has a prominent influence on its office cultrue.Take my hometown,Shanghai, for instance,most private companies there share a relatively strict office cultrue. They set up many regulations to constrian their employees with the aim of improving the working efficiency. Deadlines and specific standards are given to make sure the quanlity of work. As a result,working in a private company can be stressed out. On the other hand, the office cultrue in government sectors tells another story. There are not so much stressed-out work to do that is the main reason why a large number of people want to work as a civil servant. But you need to obey orders from your superior without doubt. It is well-defined between superiors and subordinates. No wonder that everyone craves for promotion so badly in government departments. Ps: I didn't receive any feedback from my last writing task on describing a song. Did you send the correction to my mailbox? Could you kindly send that again? Thanks a lot.
