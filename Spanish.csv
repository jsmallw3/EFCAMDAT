      I think the same of Taylorsthebest. Is easy to lie on TV. I think that Alana put him in a trap. Maybe she hired a girl to seduce Gavin, probably he fell into the trap and fell in love. So she can ask for the divorce for infidelity, if there's a trial, she will win. She gets the money, she becomes rich, single and most famous. Just like a movie. I think I've seen too many movies.

      Mr. Nelson was a kind and gentle husband but he was alcoholic. When he was drunk he used to shout and hit his wife. Last night they were at home with his sixty seven year old mother, and they had an argument. Mrs. Nelson wanted her husband to stop shouting and without intention, she grabbed a knife and stabbed Mr. Nelson in his chest. After that Mr. Nelsons fell and laid dead on the floor. Mrs. Nelson was horrified because she didnt wanted to kill him. Nelsons neighbor saw everything and he said that she killed him with the knife but it was not her intention. Mr. Nelsons mother was in the bathroom during the killing and she stated that Mrs. Nelson was a manipulating woman and she might be in prison for her whole life. Police is taking proofs and statements. It seems that the keys of this case might be if Mr. Nelson was drunk that night and If Mrs. Nelson wanted to kill her husband or not.

The first tool for a company is block certain URLs if neccesary, Why? because workers normally tend to send file attachments and use programs for chats and phone calls, avoiding these kind of tools employers can't reveal intellectual property.The employers can interchange experiences with others in order to draw significantly accurate organization charts, but always try to avoid sites like Profilme or Networker because adjust to much information others may access.

The other thing about this job is that the place is located outside the city. I went there and I can tell you it's a totally amazing location with a magnificent view. Everything seems to be very organized and clean. The animals look great (in good shape) and the air is pure, as well as the river that passes by. Finally, the pay is good enough for you since you'll receive 2000 USD a month plus health insurance and medical care. So, please don't think too much about it. Just make the decision and apply for this job. Is a nice opportunity to change your life. Kind regards.

First the departure of our plane was delayed without any explanation. When we were going to take off, the pilot made an announcement so we had to wait in the plain for someone to repair a broken window. After three hours the window was repaired, but at that moment the fog had totally invaded the runway. We had to go back to the airport and stay there all the night. I slept on the floor trying to take care of my bag and my computer. Anyway, New York is an amazing city and I am enjoying it. Kisses.

      1. No, I don't heard  about this gossip that Gavin Taylor's wife, Alana and is suing him for divorce. I never heard about  she caught him wth another woman. I think if those are true, she wins, she'll get millions of dollars. However she should their history. Some times I think that the talk show  don't allow the people  tell the true, maybe he hide her problem. I'll ber  someone is framing Gavin.2. A divorce? Sure, that is possible! There's been a hint that Gavin and Alana are breaking up because after they got married only years ago, they has  been fighting everyday. The people always gossip about newly wed celebrities. It's possible with the life of the great stars. Anybody wants him to look bad, either Alana or the media. Always the rumors become in true.3. Actually, I think so. I'm happy to say it, but I heard they have separated. Alana revealed on a TV interview tht she has moved out and is living on her own. Maybe they're got to be wrong but their disition is the most impportant.4. It's easy to lie on Tv interview but she tell her the true because it''s what appened. I think It isn't a conspiracy. If Gavin isn't chating, everybody traying to start a scandal to frame him. I'll bet it's Alana, sure that she's the cheat, and wants to make Gavin seem guilty. Anyway, she can get away with all the money, and can ger remarried.

The book tries to teach how to find a career that satisfied us by making questions about our likes, hobbies, interests and working style.

The most of advices are good, but the question is that we already know them. On the other hand and as use to be, the text forgets to mention an important issue in the searching of the perfect and gratifying job, the aptitud to develop it.

It was yesterday, my friend Meg was going out to work as usual. She got a Coffee in one hand, her laptop in the other and her handbag over her shoulder. She approached to the Elm and Fourth corner and saw a young couple get out of a car, they start to break the newsagent window with a hammer and to throw paint on the store front. My friend decided to go to talked with them in order to convince the couple to stop what they were doing, but as soon as she get closer the young woman pushed a gun into my friend stomach and grabbed her laptop and ran off down the street. Then some guy that was passing by saw the action and start to chase her until he caught her by the hair. But turns out that the buglers hair was a wig and the young woman turns out to be a teenage boy. The couple is still out there being a danger to our community thats why I believe that these stories need to be published, in order to the people and the police of the town be alert if anything similar happen. Hope you take in consideration my letter. Sincerely yours. Andres Villafuerte.

In second place, the team work and the communication are very necessary in the sales area, so you have to update the database so your colleagues can know how the customer is going. And finally, the clean is important in the office, is your responsibility to keep clean you works area, wash you coffee cup and put the trash in the trashcan.

      My favorite movie is The Notebook. This movie was released in 2004. Is an American romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes. The screenplay, written by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi, is based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars when a young couple who fall in love during the early 1940s. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident. The main issue is dementia and the attempt to recover a love that has faded because of this disease and what you can achieve pure love in this situation. The film was more popular in the female market like me.

      Green business is important tome. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a businesss shouldconsider isung renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organicm recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packing. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, wich is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      I was searching the better way to help the environment in our city. I searched and found five manners, but only one fits with our means and budget. - Solar power. In my opinion, solar power would be the most beneficial to our city. Why? Well, as you know, our city has a lot of sun light. Everyday is sunny and if we install solar panels in each home, they will absorb the sun light and will transform it in electrical energy. Sounds easy and our city has the requirements to do it. The cost of installing solar panels would come to 120,000 dollars but the maintenance costs would be low. I know it isn't too economical but it's the best way to help the environment and make our city a better place to live. We can get this money with the help of ours residents. Also, we can give to solar panels maintenance each month. So as far as I'm concerned, solar power would be the most environmentally-friendly and economically-viable way to produce renewable energy for our city.%%

Is the legal abortion from a social point of view, is legal only when there is danger to one of the parties. The government made a new law that it's legal to process the abortion, even if there is not any dangers for one or both parties. The law said as well, it is the mother own decision. For most of the people all around this country the abortion is a murder and must be punished by law. No one can kill anyone when they can not defend, which mean that the law must protect life even before birth. This is a very controversial topic, some are in favor but most is against. Others say it is a country of freedom for all, but what about those who are not born? They are lives from the moment of conception. In conclusion the live rights are for everyone.

For example if you are visiting a woman, flowers are accepted, for a man wine will be ok,  in some places also small bucket of fruit. But in the north things are totally different, most common practice is a money on a birthday card is accepted. Visiting a friend house is formal to call  at least one day before, is not polite just arrive on the last minute. Other important rules are on a restaurant appointments. Is not polite to arrive late on any date, a lot of people think that arrive 15 or 20 minutes late looks good, but not. Other common practice on a restaurant is order a center dish for all the attendances, if you are thinking to do that just be sure that all people like the food that are you thinking, for example some people hate onions, others can't eat cheese.

Is common to read on the news about murder, kidnapping, extortion. Those major crimes are punished by jail for at least 18 years, in Mexico is prohibited capital punish like letal injection, but in my opinion in this cases will apply. Other minor crimes are not punish by the law, for example minor thief with not violence on people under 18 years, teenagers just receive an advice and their parents need to pick up them at the court. But in case that in the thief is involve weapons, murder, or violence, they will go to preventive jail, and at the age of 18 receive a sentence in some cases for the crime. Those crimes are related to the common people, but all crimes that companies and government are doing, like taxes evasion, they move millions of pesos without punishment.

      Mexico is one of the countries where it is easy to buy a house, if you have a stable employment and you have worked in the same place for more than a year it can be really easy to get a bank loan to buy a house. Mexican banks are eager to authorize credits to customers who will cover the loan in time and quantity required. Interest rates are a little bit high, but are affordable for those who have employment. Houses in Mexico are good in price; the only thing is that they are pretty small if we talk about the lot. In general, in Mexico the only problem I see about buying a house is the size of the lot, but that is not a big issue if we consider that Mexico is a developing country and compared to others in the same situation, here in Mexico we can afford credits to buy our own houses. In order to get a credit in Mexico, you can go directly with the bank and ask for it, they will required some documents from you and if you filled them up, you will be ready to have an approved credit and enjoy your brand new home.%% Everardo.

As many of you know, I am a systems engineer, and this is my second career, sadly my last institution didn't accept foreign as presidents, and I asked myself 'Is that education have a stereotype arranged?' Is that education differs in ages, sex, economic situation or color? How many times in history human beings have been suffer the hit of the division? Is time to work together for better choices. If you vote for me, I will create a loan system to help poor students to apply for educational trips, I will persuade professors to embrace the new technologies and to make our classes more interactive, I will convince the Director to schedule a weekly meeting to discuss the students concerns and to improve our library! With your help and creativity I believe we can make a change from the core of the institution, having inspirational classrooms with better desks and comfortables chairs.%% Education is the way to success as a global community, and is the key to open the door of a better future.

      Dear Elizabeth, I received your proposals last week, and I arranged a workshop with all the creative department to discuss about this campaign. We did a very long brainstorm, and as a result I have huge and reliable information. First of all, I talked to the marketing directors, Marcus is just coming back from NY yesterday, so he gave me fresh and incredible ideas, that we absolutely could use for Century watches. I think that we need to avoid typical ads, right now people is surrounded by thousands of them every day, from sunrise we start the day with our cellphone, and by the end of the night how many of those we remember?. Second, we have just a few seconds to catch customers eyes and to transform that moment in possible sales. Even that I believe that using celebrities increase the awareness of the brand, I honestly feel that we urge put the watch image on the ad, it must be the protagonist of the campaign. My recommendation is to work with two images, one aimed to our women audience and the other to our men audience. But remember! don't lose the focus.. the focus is the watch! My recommendation is to work with two images, one aimed to our female audience and the other to our male audience.%% But remember! don't lose the focus.. the focus is the watch!

      The discrimination could be direct or indirect. In the text several examples o discrimination are shown. The bad thing is that the women is the gender most affected for the discrimination. For example, pregnant woman, the women that have children, etc.  I think that the work conditions are very different between the man and woman. The discrimination will continue until the rules and the activities at home and at job will be similar in both cases.  Another rude problem that the women have to face is the sexual harassment or their physical appearance. Is very sad to see that the women continue being discriminated.

So the book is showing how to determine which jobs corresponds to our personality. It is interesting how the author is showing this in two simple steps, I think it is more than that, but lets see how she thinks: -Learn about your personality. Consider the activities that really uplift you. -Learn what jobs are best suited to your personality and interests. Yo will need to be sure what is that would make you happy at work. The book is very motivational, but makes unrealistic claims.

It is too danger when driving and texting that why I agree with all the laws.

In general, the food is delicious, pastas, pizzas, steaks, fishes, etc. It has an eclectic decor that creates a pleasant atmosphere. We can see chairs on the walls and some furnitures.

      According to the Blight family's requirements the house should have enough space for the family (at least three bedrooms); if it's possible, it shouldn't need to be restored. They prefer the property to be located near the sea and they also want to rent it out when they're not there. Another important topic: money is no object. The cottage in Lefki isn't an option because, although it's been renovated, it needs a new roof and the most important, it's got only one bedroom. Hamilton House, in Kioni, in Ithaca, has enough bedrooms to meet the Blight family's demands and is in seafront. As a con I must mention the house's age, it needs a complete renovation, considering that it can't be demolish and its high price. I don't consider it as suitable. The third possibility is an apartment in Vathy, the capital of Ithaca.%% It's about an affordable 2-bedroom apartment, ready to use and near the sea, but doesn't fill all the demands. I would recommend this luxurious property in Vathy. It's a villa located near the beach only five minutes away from the centre. Nowadays it's a successful rental business and has 3 apartments and 1 studio, apart from the 111 sq m house. Amongst the fittings I can mention the full kitchen, the 4-air conditioning units or the 4 television sets. You can rent the villa and the website is yet ready to use. It's the best investment I can offer you. It costs 450.000. I hope with this advices a decision can be made.

      The exposed techniques in the previous units can be very useful for people who intend to write a piece of literature. I don't doubt about the capability of these techniques to force, or at least to improve, the flow of words if the writer is totally stuck. I have never liked writing and, in fact, when I have to present some kind of report, I must admit that one of the introduced techniques is useful for me. I refer to listing. These reports use to be rather dense, with a lot of information and technical terms too. Sometimes it's complicated to draw a scheme easy to follow for the reader. It could be said, that it's necessary to tell a story although this story is full of technical literature. That's why, unconsciously, I make a list with all the important things that have to be mentioned in the text. This list is easily changeable in order to make relations among the exposed terms. Moreover, listing allows in the end the possibility of writing a conclusion.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the products is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      In my country, we have very strict rules related with drinking alcohol. The mainly reason of this regulation is the quantity of accidents ocurred last years. Nowadays it''s absolutely prohibited any drink with a percentage of alcohol, if the police catch you, you will lose your license and you have to pay a very expensive fine. Depending the alcohol grade, you could go to jail. Also, in an effort to apply the rules, everynight the police are establishing alcohol testing sites, where they are checking the level of alcohol. If it''s level increases more than 0.4, the police will take your car. Personally I think the measures are great to protect population and save lives.

Sounds really incredible how you can read whatever you want of each part of the world in few minutes, and you do not need to be at the place where the things happened. That is really awesome. Another thing that I remembered too is the storage devices, when I was young, I used a 3-1/2 floppy disk, was terrible! because you have to handle it carefully, otherwise you lose all your information. At this moment you can use many options to storage your information, one of them is USB device, a smaller and portable device where you can manage you information without any problems in each computer that you want. The second option is through cloud, where you can save your information on the web and you can used wherever you want without any device.%% As you can see, the technology is helping us a lot to facilitate our lifes.

      In my country people tend to communicate directly to one another than indirectly, another important recommendation is not to stay too close to the person, as this is considered rude because you're invading their personal space, so be aware about that. Gestures as in many others countries are used, but what I recommend, is to do a little research about the place you're going to visit. For example, the place where I live snapping your fingers it's considered very offensive, whereas in another places in the same country is considered normal. Due to diversity of cultures all over the country, many indigenous are living now in big cities, and they can communicate in their dialect and at the same time they probably can talk in Spanish and even English, so most of their cultures communicate with gestures and they  use a wide range of gestures including bad gestures and good gestures, be aware when trying to use gestures near them, as they may think that you're talking about them and they may try to appeal at you. In overall many different verbal and non-verbal communications are allowed in my town, but just be careful when doing gestures to the people.%%

      I'm completely surprised at how all the technology in our lives can be overwhelming. For example, my wife has a Smartphone and a tablet. She uses all the applications that these devices have and she uses them to facilitate her work, she can access the most current information, and her Smartphone has a huge memory capacity and obviously video games. Another advantage is its size today you can have a smart phone that fits in your pocket and plenty of space.  I think that Technology is a double-edged sword. It has advantages and disadvantages. An advantage is the velocity with which you can stay connected with the world and you can know what is happening in the moment in distant places and one disadvantage is that many people are totally dependent on Their Smartphone, tablet or computer, they use them all time although they have no reason to use them. In my case, we have left family life, because my wife is calling, sending pictures or playing on her tablet or Smartphone all time. So T.V. has passed into history. In my opinion Technology have Given us to make Easier access our work, but unfortunately family life has taken a back seat.%%

      Personally, I think leadership skills come innate with the people, is very difficult to develop leadership skills if you did not come with that when you were born. But along our life, we can make some things for improving our weakness, for instance, we can take some leadership workshops, receiving couching from managers and evaluate our weakness and develop an action plan for improving this. I think the most important skill for a leader, is the communication skills and the influence the leader has over an audience. Is important that a leader has a clear speech, and has the ability to communicate his\her ideas in an excellent way. Other important skill is the passion for the ideas and believe in their opinions. Most of the succesfull leaders in history,  have become with a great power of conviction in the people, due to their passionate ideas they express on their speech

      Subsequently of many innocent deaths, Colombia''s  government on this year 2014, decided to create a harder law against people who drives drunk. For many years the country had to evidence awful crimes: Children, older people, young people, in general a normal  pedestrian, who has a normal life, but in one minute everything changes, just because a person decided drive drunk and finish with some lives. Unfortunately my country does not have culture and neither a trusted justice system. Last December a young person was driving  fast and drunk and crashed with a cab, inside was 2 girls, who left the work late.The girls died immediately , actually the taxi driver lost his movement from the waist down. The criminal was charged for 2 years of jail house can you imagine?? Cases like this are normal in Colombia,the laws were very weak and if you pay a fine you are able to  continue driving. Nowadays is more difficult because the government increased  the years in prison and the felon won''t have the chance to have a jail house. Obviously exist the corruption and here you can buy whatever you want if you have a lot of money.

      In Colombia, we have very lax laws about the corruption of politicians. I think that the laws are very lax because the colombians can see in the news that the people that have economic and political power can make anything for the benefit of he or his family. Is incredible that in Colombia the politics can be have a big political control that can make decisions for their own sake and not for the common. But the lax laws say that if a politic is discoverd in corruption, he will be displaced of his position and can not make position in the politic by over ten years.

You can''t make up while you are in a traffic lights stopped.Dogs can''t be at the beach while people are.

      Every day our lives are all that are involved negotiations, purchasing, sales and other transactions that we have to do or for buying something. For me, part of my job is to close negotiations through exchanges or barters. The idea is to use something from any company and then we rewarded them with what my company does. For example, I do a lot of event in the company where I work (specializing in cable TV network) and I always get things for &quot;free&quot; through negotiations that I can do and it has helped me to grow within the company. Things like hotel stays, meals, tickets to concerts among others, are things I've been able to negotiate. To exchange the barter, the company I work we give outdoor advertising on television. Always looking to both customers and us as a channel have a win - win and so everyone is happy with the negotiation performed.

Bribery could be one of the most common felonies in politics in what is related to political corruption and the punishments are supposed to be though, although in praxis, there are several judicial processes for corruption, but very few politics ends behind bars. Because of popular pressure, the sentence applied to this kind of crimes are getting harder in the law, but it is not really happening with political corruption. We should learn from countries like iceland, where the politics in charge of economic management and even the prime minister, were acussed for leaving the country broken and highly indebted after the 2007 crisis. Transparency is one of the main characteristics that should have an organization, and mainly a public government who is playing with the citizens budget.

      The media has been evidently one of the most handler powers, here in Mexico since 1900 untill now the media has become in the fourth power, because of its influence on the people's mind. The media is taken directly to our houses and wherever we are with today's technology. Apparently, in early 90's the media begin gain power due to alliances with the government. I'm really care about how connect we are with this kind of gadgets, I mean we're becoming more predictables. The T.V. is the best medium to transmit crap which stays in your mind; recently experts are developing an intelligent T.V. There is a social program leaded by the government about putting projectors in strategic points in the city were they gonna transmit intelligent programming to all the Monterrey's citizens. Recently, mobile phones are become essential, even more intelligent that some people who I know.

      The Impressionist Wing. This is a permanent exhibition, the story begins in Paris as a reaction of overly formal and rigid style of painting. The Impressionist paintors prefer paint outside and studied the effect of natural light. The Road Bridge at Argenteuil, by Claude Monet (1874). One of the characteristics of the impressionism is the use of complemental colors, blue, orange, green and red in this painting. Monet create the adequate movement of water. You can come to visit on 1st October. The Expressionist Wing Organized by two groups of German painters: The Bridge and The Blue Riders. The Blue Rider, by Franz MarcMarc who liked painting horses and experimented with bold colors, tried to capture the primitive energy of animals. These movement end with the World War 1. The cubist Wing This exhibition is part of our permanent collection you can visit from October. Is inspired by Picasso and Braque in Paris before World War One. In this movement everything was reduce to geometrical forms. Cubism prepared the land for Abstract art Le Jour, by George Braque (1929) Still life done in greens, grays, ochers and browns objects are fragmented, as if seen from multiple viewpoints but on the other hand, the composition is well-balanced.%%

When a big-box store comes to one community, always neighborhood will strongly oppose to that kind of change, people are afraid of these types of change, because it is something new something unknown, so they opposed. This scenario always has been on this way. What did the companies to avoid this social behavior? Simple, one economy teacher always said this: &quot; Pan y circo para el pueblo&quot; ( Bread and circus for people) This means give to the people some entretainment and they will focus in stupid things like asist to the opening of one of those stores only because a known artist goin to be present on stage and if there is something free as snacks or any kind of beverage, the place will be crowed, sorry if I insult somebody... but is the true, of brain-less people.

      What traits and habits make a person successful? Is a hard question and I think that in order to be able to respond it, we have to define success first. But again what success means to me is not what everybody might think it is. We can have success in all areas of our live, business, academic, social, spiritual maybe in our love life or physically. And we can focus only on one type of success and work forward to reach it. However, at least for me, I prefer define success as a whole conformed by well being in all the areas that I mentioned before. I can''t imagine myself being happy with lots of money but bad health and no friends or family. The people that I consider successful have similar traits, each and every one of them have a lot of discipline and determination, discipline can make a huge difference, they also are very kind and sociable and I think the most important trait is to be passionate and stick to your believes.

The most exhilarating part of this job is that you will have direct contact with exotic animals. The duties of this position are preparing food for animals and feed them on a daily basis. The salary is 50,000. However, due to your experience and your knowledge about animals, probably you can ask for more than this. The benefits that company offers are full accident insurance, 1 month holiday every year, and regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles.

Men have to use elegants suits with tie every day and women are use to using formal dresses or skirts with beautiful blouses and of course high heels,give or take. Perhaps on Friday workers can be more relaxed,but never forget image is everything in a laywer officce. We are more or less 15 employees and everybody has a nice relation between us. Sometimes we see out of officce to go lunch or movies or so. I aprecciate my job, the only thing I would changed is the salary!! How much? about 20% will be great.

In my case, I'm a developer software and I work from monday to friday. However, my profession demands 7/24 availability, because sometimes a very important problem occurs. This kind of problems are not common if the company is organized, however, anything can happend at any time. I know about others companies where their employees are very busy all the time and they work extra-time many times (for month even for week or daily at least while the current project are not finish yet). For another kind of jobs, when the people is not professional, the things can be different, for example, a taxi driver must work from 5 o'clock a.m to 9 p.m more or less, because he need get money for the taxi owner and for himself to survive, It's really hard. Another example is persons (normally women) who works like a maid in different places by a daily pay. Is a hard job, they need to work all day, never take vacations, several times they are single mothers and they need to pay someone who take care for their childrens, and pay rent, food, clothes, study for their childrens etc etc etc.%%... that life is tough.

We meet once a week to talk about job and activities related with the job. A mid-year, we integrated with coworkers of the same area and we have a lot of fun. At the end of year, the company organizes a party... is so funny. PD: I have a right to 15 days of vacation each year.

Is so sad watching youth wasting time robing and taking drugs, while their parents do nothing about it. However crime has decrised, you cannot walk on the streets of Monterrey,unfurtanitly our lows aren't the best solution. There are many delicuents which parents know they need to be help. politicians refuce to do someting. Pettyy crime is considered less serius in Mexico city. we have to keep our eye in the ball.

So if you think possitively, then possitively things are waiting for you. Is as if we were a big magnet that attracts every thing that is like us. In other words, we can have all that we want if we really want it, and we work for it.

      The table manners are useful because these rules establish an standard for eating with the purpose of not disturb or annoy to other people that are eating in the same table. The first step, is always wash your hands before eat, that is very important for avoid health concerns. Then, you have to know when you can start to eat. Some families, perform some activities before start eating, for example, some religious families always pray before eating. When you are eating, you could have problems in selecting each cutlery for each dish, but I think that it is very intuitive, just select the cutlery that you think is more appropiate or comfortable to use (after all, the cultery as any other invention are for simplify the tasks). Is a good idea to talk about interesting things while eating, but you have to care about of don't speak with your mouth full. It's a good politic to leave some food in your plate after you end with the aim of let know your host that you are satisfied.

      Mexico City is one of the most populous cities in the world. Is modern and cosmopolitan, multicultural and packed with historic sites. Mexico city is an exciting blend of Aztec, Spanish colonial and modern art and architecture. It''s also a huge, sprawling city. The Plaza de la Constitucin or Zocalo is the city''s main square. The Presidential Palace, with its famous Diego Rivera murals, is a beatiful place to visit. The surrounding Centro Historico (Historic Center) is a virtual museum of colonial architecture and was built on ruins of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The Templo Mayor, one block from the Zocalo, is the most important relic of that period. The Torre Latinoamericana is located near to the Zocalo and is one of the tallest buildings in the zone. It is an amazing building built more than fifty years ago. It has an unique observation roof that takes advantage of an equally privileged location in the heart of downtown Mexico City. We can forget the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of fine arts) that is the most important cultural center in Mexico City. It is located on the west side of the Historic Center of Mexico City.

It''s well seen if you give the sit to elder people and help them to cross the street. When you are eating it''s a bad manner to put your elbows on the table and speak while you are chewing.

      Good manners In my country when you finished eating and you leave the table you say &quot;provecho&quot; to everyone. Is like a thankfull for the meals. The men open the door when a woman is going to enter to some place When a man is walking beside a woman, the woman have to walk near the wall and the man near the street. When a man invite a woman to go out somewhere is kind if he pays everything. When a woman go out of a car is nice if the man open the door. Give your seat to an elderly person Give a present in a birthday party When someone invite you to their home, is good if you arrive there with a present Bad manners When you''re eating it's rude if your talk at the same time. Arrive late to a date Say bad mouths When you are invited to a house and you stay late night in that place it's rude if you don''t go despite when you see the hostest is tired

      Is very hard to pinpoint what are the traits a person needs to become a successful one. because when I was young, and I was in the elementary I met a very intelligent girls, They had a very high scores in the school. But when they grew up, they didn''t make any different from the rest of the people. They were very normal, even one of them didn''t study the University !. In the other hand I had other friends from the same school who didn''t have good scores, even they were misfits. But when they grew up they became a successful people. Nowadays I wonder what this depends on ? Maybe another factors have influence in this matter. Maybe if you're intelligent in school is good, but you need others skills, be talent, have a target, have an emotional intelligent, to be bold in social situations, and maybe being encourage to reach all that you want. I still thinking this is a mysterie ! Some people says the people who can became successful have similar facial features...

You aren't allowed to speak, you have to use gestures with, hands, legs, fingers, namely, you are allowed to use your body. The person who guesses first what you are saying have the next turn. So, overall, in the game you try to one of the players guess the word that you are saying with your gestures, because you are not allowed to speak, so, the player who guess what you are saying, is the next who have to act out.

      Some years ago, the government of my country established a law that doesn't allow smoking in any public place. Neither bars, restaurants nor closed places as offices and stores. In my view, it was a great idea. Since the law took effect on 2008, the consumption of cigarettes has gone down dramatically. Many of my friends and colleagues quit smoking. In their opinion, outdoors smoking is not comfortable and enjoyable because is a social habit. Other people used to smoke inside buildings for studying or working in order to get concentration. But, now they have to go outdoors to smoke. Is important to note, that government has instrumented other kind of policies to discourage smoking, per example: charge an additional tax to cigarettes and forbid their sale to teenagers. To my mind, smoking cigarettes is terrible poison that has been damaging health of people for decades. Addiction to nicotine is really injurious for health. Personally, I support this kind of laws.

      English has been very useful in my life. I started to learn it when at the school when I was 6 and from then I've never stopped learning it. Sometimes it's frustrating when I try to explain an idea and to I realize I need more vocabulary, but more or less I always get it using similar sentences or other words. I work as a computing engineer, so English is definitively a very important language. Every day I need to read articles which are written in English, and it's also very common to write in English for communicating with other people. Where I've used English the most is on holiday. No matter where I go, I know that using English I'm not going to have any problem in the hotel or with people who organize the activities. To sum up, there's no doubt that English is a compulsory language to know nowadays.

Her voice was clear and strong, and she looked at people around the room instead of just staring at her notes. Another thing she did well was to summarize her key points in the conclusion. I left the presentation remembering each important idea. And her flowcharts were compelling. One of them perfectly explained a procedure I had never really understood before. On the other hand, one thing she could have done differently was to grab people's attention during the opening. Is she had given us an interesting fact or figure, for example, I thing some people would have felt more relaxed and motivated. Finally, I would have liked it if she had given more examples of the pavroll procedures. I'm still not sure how to complete a time report.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in muy neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shope at green grocey stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthty food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from compaines I know a lot about.

      I used to have a different attitude about life when I was younger, I would say a wrong one. I lived as if life was a rehearsal, as if I had plenty of time to do whatever I wanted sometime in the future. One thing I've learned as I've gotten older is that I don't have too much time, that life's short, that time's precious... Another thing that I keep always in front of my mind is that it's happiness what makes life worthwhile. This was what has driven me trough live since I understood it. I wish I would have done it before. Anyway, I think you need time to be happy, because happiness is something you build. Is not reached by seeking it, but by allowing it to come into your life. And you need time to find the way...

      One of my favourite song is &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by the artist Josh Woodward. Is an acustic song, there are only one voice and one acustic guitar. In the first minute the melody is slowly and it have some high tones followed by down tones. After that he starts to play much rude and the song becomes into a very zippy music. Finally the end has a decreasing melody. I think that is a good song to listen it when you are alone because is important to pay attention to the lyrics. And if you play the guitar is easy for playing and singing.

      Dear Elizabeth, After several hours discussing about the possible ad campaigns with the team, weve finally selected one for Century Watches. The fist thing we did was to answer the question: The Century Watches, whom is aimed at? Apparently, the Century Watches appeals to a customer who searches for success, high quality, classical lifestyle, guarantee, etc. But we wanted to know what truly thinks the customer about the brand. Thats the reason why we made a focus group and we found out some interesting and surprising information. The people, when think about the brand Century Watches, identify it with glamour, elegance and fashionable lifestyle. Allowing to that fact, weve considered that the selling point should be glamour, and therefore the perfect slogan campaign must be Your glamour; your Century. The ad would feature a scene of Marilyn Monroe surrounded with journalist and flashes during a press session. Kind regards, Anna

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

      Is very important that a country has strict laws to regulate the driving condicions. But unfortunately in countries like Mexico we don''t have a good driving culture to make it works. Definitely all this driving rules were made to protect us and decrease the number of accidents, but there are too much corruption, many oficials get money avoiding fines and causing that respect for law decrease and the enormous quantity of accidents still continues getting up. So I think it''s very important to promote that is a safety concerns to observe this kind of laws, protect the people life is the primary reason of law.

There are many examples: species in extinction, polluted rivers, foul air We are making the Earth less habitable. That is why many people are figuring out how they can help to fix this complicated situation. And many of them are working in the consumption chain. That means that they are green buyer or green producer. That is a fantastic idea. Many sources are wasting because an unconscious consumption. What is better than try to let the people consume greener than offer them green products? But this way of thinking created another problem. Many companies are cheating about their products to obtain benefits of this trend.  Thats the human nature, anything is perfect.

In my opinion, soap operas creators must make other kind of stories such as romantic, humor, and comedian. We have been living violence so we dont want to remember that every night. Is also important that the restrictions will be the strongest on them because the time they show on TV.

      Should we fight for gender equality? I think there are a lot of gender differences in Mexico. I agree we should receive equal pay for equal work, but I''m not sure if we are able to do the same things. Is very important to see there are a lot of body differences, for example, and these give us differents habilities. I think Humans have to acept their gender differences and try to do something productive with these. In the other hand, talking about some activities, some people in my country thinks that women are the only gender that have to knit because they think that to knit is an activitie in wich you give &quot;life&quot; to your creation, if this is true, the only gender who is able to give life are females, for that reason they think males don''t have to knit. I''m glad to see how that is changing.
