      I'm going to go to a music festival in September. It will take place from 15th September to 25th September in Berlin, Germany. Tickets cost about 45 euro. I'm going to stay for a few days in a hotel and for two or three days with my friends. In September is usually warm, but perhaps it will be rain. So I'll need to take an umbrella and a raincoat with me. I'll pack a pair of jeans, a few t-shirts and a pullover as well. There are stages with different kinds of music. So I can listen to music that I like.

If he knocked out all of the bottles, then he takes two more shots and all the points are added together. Wins the player with the most points. It's not recommended to play on a very windy day!

      In my country most of the people watching the TV.  As far as I can remember the level tv program we can to see in top right circle by color. If the red color it is that in this program contains violence or sex. If the color of the circle is blue that a program is for viewing with adult. And if the color of the circle is green that a program is safe for viewing for children. In my opinion, currently is dangerous not TV, but the Internet. Is needed set basically more strongly brandmauer in the OS of the PC, tablets and other devices, which is available for children.

      Is gender difference in Ukraine has same popularity in discussions as in the other countries like UK, US etc. ? I would say yes and no. Yes, because we do have gender inequality. Women from old times used to sit at home, look after their children, they were housewifes. Nowadays there are still woman  are sitting at home and they don't change the old traditions.  However, time have been changed a lot and now women almost equal men and they are actually doing same things as most of men. As for me, great difference in my country is that entrepreneur prefer to hire or promote women for a top position, as a GM or even CEO than a men. Because there is a tendency to consider that women are more responsible, creative, friendly etc. than men. On the other hand there are also some facts about woman why they can not be hired for top positions. In conclusion, for my opinion gender equality is very important to make people free, equal and make them feel that they are unique.

      My ideas about the future are very different. I believe that innovative technology will help people a lot in many spheres of our life such as medicine, communication. But i think some of changes don't make people more happy. We are so attached to the new devices so it's hard to imagine our life without them. Seems we spent more time online then with our friends. Technology might help us but the environment is a big problem now. Would be great if we have balance think about the future more global.

      I live in a beautiful and big residence, it has 9 floors and each floor has a lot of rooms for two or three people. I live in room for two people with my wife, but we share the bathroom with 2 roommates. My room is small but so lovely, in my room we have everything we need to live comfortable. We have a modern refrigerator and a big TV, but the microwave is old. Sometimes the neighborhood is noisy. The kitchen is ugly and sometimes a little bit dirty.
