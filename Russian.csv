      The most terrifying day of lifeOne day my friend was going out to work as usual round eight in the mornig. As he was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, he saw a young couple get out of the car.He was surpised when they suddenly began vandalizing the local newsagents. They were breaking the window with hammer, and throwing paint on the store front. My friend decided to go over to them to see if he could get them to stop. Suddenly the young woman came at him waving a gun. She pushed the gun into his stomach, and started talking very fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world. It was astonishing! My friend was terrifyed she was going to shoot him. After what seemed like a lifetime, but probably only a few seconds really, she grabbed his laptop off and ran off down the street. A passer-by chased her and caught her the hair. Somehow she managed to escape. But not befor this guy grabbed her hair, at which point it came off in his hands! Turns out it was a wig. And the young woman wasn't a young woman at all, but a teenage boy.

      The Impressionist Wing Impressionism began in Paris as a reaction to a very formal an rigid style of painting. Impressionsts painters preffered to paint outside and they studied the effects of light. &quot;The Road Bridge at Argenteuil&quot; by Claude Monet,1874 The painting shows the River Seine and its boats. One of the characteristics of impessionism is using the complimentary colors as seen in the painting. Monet and other impressionsts wanted to capture the effects of lights, to convey their sensory experience. This exhibit ends in January, 3rd. The Expressionist Wing The expressionist's movement was orginized by two groups of German painters: The Bridge and The Blue Rider. Blue Rider artists included Franz Marc, Paul Knee and Wassily Kandinsky. &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; by Franz Marc Marc devoted much of his career to paint horses. He experimented with bold colors to express a primitive energy of animals. This movement was ended by outbreake WW1. The Cubist Wing. Cubism was initiated by Pablo Picasso and George Braque in Paris before WW1. In this movement all is reduced to geometrical forms and fragmentation. Cubism is forerunner of abstract art. &quot;Le Jour&quot; by George Braque , 1929 Objects are fragmentes as if seen from multiple viewpoints, but on the other hand, the composition is well-balanced.

However new studies show that 47% of men between 18 to24 purchase at least one magazine a month. On the contrarily only 29% of young women do the same. So, to my mind, we need to latch on this trend. But theres a catch. On the one hand we know theres no strong competition between mens magazines, on the other hand we need to specify the topics. We need to understand clearly who our reader is. Is he a businessman, a hunter, a teenager or a computer geek. Experts argue that you cant combine different spheres of life in one magazine, but maybe we should try. Well make our product universal and not only men will be interested in that, but also women.

      O, brother, where art thou? (2000) was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen based on Homers Odyssey as they say. The main star is George Clooney. The story set in 1937 somewhere near the Mississippi. Ulysses Evert McGill (George Clooney) and his friends (they are friends just because they are linked by one chain in prison) are escaping from prison and traveling in rural Mississippi looking for a treasure. In fact there is no any treasure, McGill just want to prevent his ex-wife marriage. This is delightful absurd social satire with unpredictable plot and an great variety of colour background features. Its hard to say for me if the description of society of US South in 1937 is correct enough, but we can surely say the humour is quite modern. Starring George Clooney looks quite naturally as an escaped prisoner. Two thumbs up!

They broke the shop window with a hammer and threw paint on the store front. Meg decided to stop them, but the young woman came to her waving a gun. She pushed the gun into Meg's stomach and started to talk about consumerism and other weird things. Meg was really scared. Suddenly this woman grabbed Meg's laptop off her and ran off down the street. Fortunately, a passer-by chased her and caught her by the hair. Turns out it was a wig, and the young woman was not a woman, but a teenage boy. He managed to escape, and now Meg is scared to leave the house.

      Hello everyone! Lets look at the trends in international and national sales figures in the Best Book Company (BBC). The international sales have been rising sharply since 2004, but then they slowed growth in mid-2004. Although the cost of living fell gradually in mid-2005, sales have increased dramatically this year. Since mid-2006, the company increased its domestic market and selling in the foreign market is slowly reduced to 2007. In 2007, the exports tax rate have been increasing, and sales fell by half. Now they are on the same level. As far as domestic sales, since 2004, they have grown steadily. Between 2005 and 2006 the company reduced losses and sales are not growing. From 2006 to mid-2007 sales showed strong growth. However, in mid-2007, inflation rose sharply and sales have decreased dramatically. Currently, they are slowly coming down.

They were breaking the window with a hammer and throwing paint on the store front. When Meg got an attempt to stop them, suddenly the young woman came at her waving a gun. Meg was shocked and terrified she was going to shoot her. After a few seconds she grabbed Meg's laptop off and ran off down the street. A passer-by chased her and caught her by the hair. Turns out it was a teenage boy in a wig. Somehow he managed to escape. It's known they haven't caught the couple yet. It's worring to think about them still out there.

      Our exhibition will include the focus on three paintings in particular: The Road Bridge at Argenteuil - Claude Monet. This work was done in 1874. Monet applied soft small strokes of different tints and shades to create the quiet movement of the water. Monet and other Impressionists wanted to capture the effects of light and atmosphere and convey their sensory experience. Exhibit ends on 3 January. The Blue Rider - Franz Marc. His compositions were radical and he experimented boldly with color to express the primitive energy of animals. Part of the permanent collection, closes on on 1 October for refurbishment Le Jour - George Braque. He painted 'Le Jour' in 1929. Its a still life done in muted greens, grays, ochers and browns.

      1) Impressionism is a movement that began in Paris. It was a reaction to a very formal style of painting. &quot;The Road Bridge at Argenteuil&quot; by Claude Monet was painted in 1874 on site and shows the boats on the River Seine. He used a contemporary blue-orange and green-red colors. He used soft small strokes of different tints and shades to create the movement of water. Exhibit ends on 3 January. 2) Expressionism was organized by two groups of German painters. One member of one of these groups is Franz Marc. In his painting &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; he uses his experience in painting horses and other animals. He likes to experiment with colors to express the primitive energy of animals. Closes on 1 October. 3) Cubism was initiated by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and the Frenchman George Braque in Paris. George Braque painted &quot;Le Jour&quot; in 1929. It shows still life done in muted greens, grays, ochers and browns. Opens on 1 October and it runs through to 31 March.

      What we can see from the graph &quot;Sales Figures for the Best Books company&quot;: If we pay attention at the line graph, describing national sales from 2004 till 2008, we can notice that there were 2 periods of dynamic growth in sales - in 2004-2005 and in 2006-2007. Between these periods there was a period of stability in 2005-2006. Nowadays the figures are not that good, and we can see that after 2007 the dramatic and progressing downturn happened. From the line, describing international sale figures, it''s pretty obvious that after a dramatic rise in 2004 and 2005, the fall of sales that we are observing from 2005 continues to progress, despite of the two stable periods. Now the figures are quite similar to ones we could observe in 2007. So the sales are lower than in 2006 and earlier, but quite stable.

I think that it's important to find a way to learn which could be the most appropriate, fast and useful for you.So by now my strategies are - reading, watching or listening new material, and then extract new lexis from there, and start to work with it. I distribute new vocabulary into the groups of 10, and then write small dialogs, stories or just sentences to try to use those words immediately and in a right situation. Sometimes it could be useful to think up and write something not that ordinary - but, on the contrary, funny, maybe even hilarious. It helps a lot when you want to speed up your learning.

Let me tell you why you definitely should apply for this job! Yesterday I was reading through different ads in a newspaper trying to find something suitable for you. I know that jobs like a secretary or sales assistant are not for you because as soon as you are a very active and lively person you need a job that will push you to the limit and give you fresh impressions. Suddenly I saw that advertisement. Flossington Zoo is searching for a new zookeeper (I do hope that the previous one was not eaten by a lion or a crocodile, ha:).

First of all, it is outdoors job - just imagine that you can forget about sitting in a stuffy office staring at a computer. Your responsibilities will include preparing food for animals and feeding them everyday. Sounds exilarating! The second reason why you should apply for this job is a really decent salary. Look, they offer a salary of $50 000! Also you will get a full accident insurance, 1 month holiday a year and regular trips to Florida to observe crocs! As for me - sounds totally awesome! Anna, I want to encourage you to think about it very carefully. Anyway you could always try? am I right? If it looks attractive to you - just send them your CV as soon as possible.

      The term &quot;career&quot; has many meanings. It comes from the Latin carrus - cart, the cart and the Italian carriera - Running, life path, career. The most popular definition of &quot;career&quot; - progress on one of the chosen path, for example, getting more power, higher status, prestige, power, money. &quot;Make a career,&quot; for us, first of all means to achieve a prestigious position in society and a high level of income.However, one can associate only with a career promotion. This concept can be applied to other situations in life. It is therefore advisable to give the following definition: career - the result of conscious attitudes and human behavior in work related to official or professional growth. The notion of a career can not be attributed only to work, we can talk about a career as an occupation, activity. For example, a career manager, sports career, military career, artistic career, career, housewives, mothers and students. Human life outside of work has a significant impact on a business career, being part of it.Komarov [4] says that if you look at different schemes, reflecting a system of personnel work in enterprises, roughly, before 1995, you will notice the absence of such a subsystem as a &quot;career planning&quot;. This is explained by the following circumstances. First, there was an unspoken taboo against any &quot;research&quot; about a career as such. Dominant ideological doctrine that &quot;the Soviet people for a career does not work, but for the sake of society.&quot; The way &quot;up&quot; is usually traced briefly in the obituaries, which succinctly stated that &quot;such a fellow, then worked his way from work to the head of a certain rank,&quot; consistently occupying certain positions.Secondly, the nomenclature of heads of a certain level has been the prerogative of the party committees. It is they, not the personnel departments of ideologically and organizationally functioned as career planning, both horizontally (&quot;to strengthen the area of ??work&quot;) and vertical (&quot;to enhance leadership&quot;). For the Communist Party, it was a powerful lever of personnel policy. So, naturally, that the employees staffing services companies were not and could not be a &quot;career experience&quot;.Third, if based on an analysis of practice of the time, you can not argue that the party committees on behalf of the elected members and staff owned the methods of career planning. Right on the function does not mean professional accomplish it. Party committees at various levels make decisions about appointments, moves, shifts, but did not engage in the strict sense of the term career planning personnel.Career has the motives, based on which managers make active efforts to achieve specific goals. These reasons include:Autonomy. A man driven by a desire for independence, being able to do everything their own way. As part of the organization of its high yield position, status, authority, merit, with which all are forced to reckon with.The functional competence. Man strives to be the best specialist in their field and be able to solve the most complex problems. For this, he focuses on professional development and promotion of the official views through the prism of a professional. By the material side of things these people are generally indifferent, but appreciate the external recognition by the administration and colleagues.Security and stability. Manages the activities of workers striving to maintain and strengthen its position in the organization, so the main task they considered getting the post, which gives such guarantees.Managerial competence. Man manages the desire for power, leadership, success, which are associated with a higher position, rank, title, status symbol, an important and responsible work, high wages, privileges, recognition, leadership, rapid advance through the ranks.Entrepreneurial creativity. People striving to create a direct or organize something new, be creative. Therefore, the main motive for these careers - finding of the necessary power and freedom, which gives the corresponding position.The need for the championship. The person to seek a career in order to be everywhere and always the first to &quot;get around&quot; their colleagues.Lifestyle. Man seeks to integrate the needs of individuals and families, for example, to get an interesting, fairly high paying job that provides freedom of movement, dealing with their time, etc. If a person has no family, then in the first place can go meaningfulness of work, its excitement, diversity.Material well-being. Directs people desire to obtain a position associated with a high salary or other compensation factors.Providing healthy. Employee driven by the desire to reach the post, which involves the execution of their duties in good conditions. For example, it is understandable when the head of the foundry plant to strive to become the deputy director of the company and go with environmentally harmful production, and head of branch, located above the Arctic Circle, is seeking the post, which allows to be closer to the south.With increasing age and skill motives tend to change careers. You can give a classification of types of knowledgeable career (Fig. 1):'''In Fig. 1 Types of careersIntraorganizational career means that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through all stages of development: education, entering employment, professional development, support and development of individual professional skills, retirement. These stages of a particular employee is consistently in the walls of an organization. This career can be specialized and unspecialized.Career inter-organizational (professional) means that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through all stages of development: education, entering employment, professional development, support and development of individual professional skills, retirement. This stage is an employee consistently worked in various positions in different organizations. This career can be specialized and unspecialized.Specialized career characterized by the fact that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through various stages of career. These stages of a particular employee may pass successively in one and in different organizations, but within a profession and field of activity in which he specializes. For example, the head of sales department of one organization became head of sales at another organization. This transition is associated with an increase or remuneration for work, or change the content, or with prospects for advancement. Another example: personnel manager was appointed deputy. Director of Human Resources organization, where he works.Non-specialized career is highly developed in Japan. The Japanese are firmly of the opinion that the manager must be an expert, able to work on any part of the company, not a separate function. Climbing the corporate ladder, a person must be able to look at the company from different angles, without stopping at one position for more than three years. Thus, it is considered quite normal if the head of marketing is changing places with the head of the department of supply. Many Japanese leaders in the early stages of his career working in the trade unions. As a result, the Japanese director of such a policy has a much smaller amount of specialized knowledge (which in any case lose their value after five years) and also has a holistic view of the organization, backed by the same personal experience. Stages of an employee's career can go in one, and in different organizations.Career Vertical - type career, which most often relate the concept of a business career, as in this case, the promotion of the most visible. Under a vertical career meant the rise to a higher level of structural hierarchy (promotion, which is accompanied by higher wage

Employee driven by the desire to reach the post, which involves the execution of their duties in good conditions.

You can give a classification of types of knowledgeable career (Fig. 1):'''In Fig. 1 Types of careersIntraorganizational career means that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through all stages of development: education, entering employment, professional development, support and development of individual professional skills, retirement. These stages of a particular employee is consistently in the walls of an organization. This career can be specialized and unspecialized.Career inter-organizational (professional) means that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through all stages of development: education, entering employment, professional development, support and development of individual professional skills, retirement. This stage is an employee consistently worked in various positions in different organizations. This career can be specialized and unspecialized.Specialized career characterized by the fact that a particular employee in the course of his career goes through various stages of career. These stages of a particular employee may pass successively in one and in different organizations, but within a profession and field of activity in which he specializes. For example, the head of sales department of one organization became head of sales at another organization. This transition is associated with an increase or remuneration for work, or change the content, or with prospects for advancement. Another example: personnel manager was appointed deputy. Director of Human Resources organization, where he works.Non-specialized career is highly developed in Japan. The Japanese are firmly of the opinion that the manager must be an expert, able to work on any part of the company, not a separate function. Climbing the corporate ladder, a person must be able to look at the company from different angles, without stopping at one position for more than three years. Thus, it is considered quite normal if the head of marketing is changing places with the head of the department of supply. Many Japanese leaders in the early stages of his career working in the trade unions. As a result, the Japanese director of such a policy has a much smaller amount of specialized knowledge (which in any case lose their value after five years) and also has a holistic view of the organization, backed by the same personal experience. Stages of an employee's career can go in one, and in different organizations.Career Vertical - type career, which most often relate the concept of a business career, as in this case, the promotion of the most visible. Under a vertical career meant the rise to a higher level of structural hierarchy (promotion, which is accompanied by higher wage

      Ryazan is an old beautiful city in Russia. Ryazan has a traditional architectural organization that is usual to other old Russian cities. The city was built aroun the Kremlin. The Kremlin is the defensive complex surrounded by the walls with towers. Ryazan Kremlin has its main cathedral. It is a grand structure 267 feet height. Its size exceeded almost all contemporary buildings. Being a unique monument of ancient art, it is an unsurpassed example of organic blend of architecture, sculpture and iconography. The unparalleled masterpiece of the Main Cathedral is carving on the white stone of portals and windows of the Cathedral. Nowadays the Kremlin remains the most favourite place of citizens and visitors. Another round of city development was during Soviet Union times. There were built four huge sleeping districts during that time. All ditricts were well-planned and its houses had typical design. This trait made it awkward to find the needed house. In contrast with Soviet Union buildings the mordern architecture is more diverse and colorful. But at the same time people find it unorganized, unfortunately. However, I am sure every visitor would find the place he or she likes and would like to visit Ryazan again.%%

I started realize that the majority of people I was deal with evaluated me as energetic, professional and strong person. For me that was as an opening. Seems I used to underestimate myself. When I was a CEO of a recruitment agency, I was able to create my team, to teach people, to earn their trust. I was both strict in business and interested in my staff. No doubts, they respected me because even during troubles the company had they stayed with me and did not complain. I know that if I invite them to work with me again it will be a pleasure for most of them. So, what the essence of leadership is? In my opinion, it is a mix of different skills and personal qualities. For instance, you should be professional, educated and experienced. On the other hand, a critical point is your ability to be good with people, to be involved in their needs, to be able to emphasize and understand your team.

The Imressionist Wing The movement began in Paris as a reaction to traditional and overly-rigid style. Imressionists preferred to paint outside and studied the effect of natural light. Featured painting in the collection- 'The Road Bridge at Argenteuil' painted in 1874 by Claude Monet. He depicted the boats on the River Siene, using soft small strokes,tints and shadows and complementary colors. Exhibit ends on the 3 January. The Expressionist Wing This direction in art was organised by two groups of German painters: The Bridge and The Blue Rider(Franz Marc,Paul Klee). Marc liked painting horses, blending various bold colors. His obsession was capturing the primitive energy of animals. Exhibition closes on 1 October for refurbishment. The Cubist Wing This movement was founded by inspired Picasso and Braque in Paris. The main characteristic of the emerged direction is as follows: use of geometrical forms,vague and ambuguous viewpoints of figures. Opens on 1 October and it runs through to 31 March.%% We are sure you'll be astounded by our mighty museum,  so we highly recommend you to visit our permanent collections.

Just get up a little bit earlyer and cook some sandwiches or other snacks.

      The office culture where I work in not very formal. Employees may wear any clothes they like. Off course they don't come to office dressed like at the beach or the night club. Some employees in our company have duties to meet with investors,  to negotiate with the banks or represent the interests of the company in court, they naturally have to dress in formal style. In our company very many employees. I don't even familiar with most of them. In department where I work there are ten coworkers. All people work about 40 hours a week. Sometimes it's nessesary to do some work on weekend. Then you may get a free day later. I have approximately four weeks to rest each year. I take vacation two or three times a year, 48 days in a total.

      Two years ago there was a biggest storm in our locality. I was at my holiday home on the weekend. It was the evening. Suddenly a strong wind arose. For  few minutes wind had become so violent, that two big birches fell down on the roof of my house. They were not been broken, they were been uprooted from the land. It was terrible. I was on the second floor. I heard a loud crack. Windows glasses were broken and shards of glass were everywhere. The roof was breached. I ran outside. All over the township many trees fell down. Some trees broke electric lines, others destroyed houses. Luckily nobody was killed or injured. Emergency services and residents for a month worked for restore a normal life in the township.

      Green business is important for me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly green, a business should consider using renewable energy such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood and I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to buy green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, which is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

Bread is a symbol of wellbeing, and salt is an amulet to protect the person from some hostile forces. The towel is a symbol of purity and kind thoughts. The guest has to break off a slice of bread, salt and eat it. It means that he is in the friendly relations.  If the guest refuses to take bread and salt, its perceived as a big insult.

      First of all I want to say, that I am living in Moscow, Russian Federation and I want to describe architecture of buildings in this city, which was built in 20th century. When you first attend Moscow, you always pay attention to huge and thrilling buildings which look like Empire State Building in NY. These buildings are called &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; - group of seven skyscrapers, they were built in USSR from 1947 to 1953 and designed in Russian Baroque and Gothic styles, also it was used some technology which was used in building first American skyscrapers. The result all of this - is just amazing. Nowadays a lot of people all over the world associate these buildings with Moscow, and it is true. I cannot imagine my city without these awe and breathtaking skyscrapers. I think that for a lot of people &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; remind all about horrible regime and times of past century, but it is also reminds all of us, how great was the conception of communism and socialism and how great was people that lived in that difficult times. You feel some strength and power in these buildings, when you stay opposite each of them. It is some feeling of awe and greatness.%% . In the end I want to say, despite all of these contradictions these buildings stay one of the most attractive things in architecture of present Moscow.

      A few years ago in Russia there was introduced a new system of the entrance examinations in the colleges. Now the graduates of the high schools take the tests in some obligatory subjects and some subjects by their own choice. These tests called The Unified state examination (USE). Graduates bring to the colleges their documents and scores of the USE. After that, colleges count minimum level of scores and enlist the students. When I was graduated from the high school, there was the another system of the entrance examinations. I passed examinations in the school and in the college too, and I did not take the tests - all the examinations were written or oral.

In my family, everyone likes reading absolutely each genre of fiction and nonfiction. I can't say we had a lot of books but I went to the public library fairly often. In addition, both my brother and I had to read the classical literature for our school. I recall that made me crazy, I asked myself why they were so long and badly boring. I was enough small to realized them. That goes back a ways, what I really loved - magazines for children! Likely, I remember all of them very well. In those days, there wasn't so much information, my parents received five newspapers, that were black-white and truly big, per week. Mom and dad prefer reading after work day with a cup of hot tea and discuss news. Nowadays it sounds romantically. Lately, I mind my family: everyone has an own computer, surfs the Net, reads online, blogs, turns photos. Unfortunately, we become farther from each others, we have information about every person but we forget about the closest ones. Have a nice day.%%

      My favorite place where I like eating is an ukrainian restaurant called &quot;Puzata Khata&quot;. It's a perfect menu. There are many authentic dishes and traditional ukrainian food. The restaurant has wonderful design and native musicians. Sometimes it's too noisy especially on the weekends. I prefer to have a dinner with my friends here on Friday after work. I always order a mushroom soup, green salad and chocolate ice-cream. Also I like to drink fresh juice and coffee with milk. The prices are enough medium size. I never payed more than 50$. I would like to recommend to visit this restaurant. I promise you'll enjoy this meal and atmosphere.

Also I have my own style that isn't dependent on what is in vogue today. My favorite color is blue so I try to combine something bright with light or navy blue. I love natural clothes in this way I'd rather buy cotton or wool than polyester or synthetic things. Sometimes it's more expensive especially if we prefer the top brands. In summer, I like wearing sports clothes and prefer casual style. In addition that season the best time for dresses. I have more than 30 ones.

      When it comes to gender differences in Russia, the country where I grew up and have lived vast majority of my life, I could say times definitely have changed. Can you guess, how it reflecled on men and women attitude to their gender responsibity?! I attemt to describe. In days of old, men always were strong, courageous and were in charge of family budget completely, whereas women were like flowers, sentimental, delicate and mostly kept a home in cleanness, worm and cosiness, at the same time brought up their lovely children. Nowadays it seems as if nothing has changed in our needs. In fact, it has changed in our actions! The Second World War caused a serious current deficit of men. To be more specific, only one sixth part of inhabitance in Russia is men... Actually, it's incredibly a little. Well, however that may be, this fact forces women to become more independent and strong moral. In addition, men are getting more relaxed and weaker in this shameful women competition for being in love. It's such a complicated essue, this is that I can say exactly...

At the beginning she has presented compelling statistic data showing that the new service is really necessary. The audience became very interested. However, the next points of the presentation were rather boring - bullets, more bullets and much more bullets. I think she could have shown schemes, flowcharts and bars, i.e. use more visual aids than small and complicated text. Another thing she could have done more clearly was the conclusion. Unfortunately, she haven't summarized the key points of her presentarion, so it didn't really work. On the other hand, I liked her answers to our questions.

      Dear Paula! In reference to your inquiry regarding your financial situation I would like to give you a few advices. First of all you shouldnt buy double latte coffee every morning. If you need something to invigorate yourself, you can drink coffee at home or by something cheaper  black tea, for example. Secondly you can prepare your lunch up-front at home and eat it in the office kitchen. Also you can buy something cheaper and healthier. Anyway it will help you save money and change fast food to healthy one. I think you should also give up going to restaurants. On the other hand you shouldnt stop meeting with your friends. So the best decision would be inviting your friends to parties at your home. Sometimes it might be even better than going to restaurants, because you can listen to music that you all like, watch movies and play different games! Its very fun and cheap. Finally I would advise you to think hard about your other expenditures. I hope my advices will be useful for you. Sincerely yours, Jack Wise

      Good everyone. My name is Jane Smith, and I am the person who wants to be the President of the Student Council. Today I'd like to share my dreams and thoughts with you. Our school has seen better days. Everyone knows it. All of you have seen obsolete computer class, deteriorating gym equipment, and really OLD chairs and desks in classrooms. Is this going to change? Absolutely! After my initial consultations with the Principal I am sure we can raise funds to replace old equipment, at least 30% of it in just this year (it means about 10 computers, new carpet in gym, and some new desks). Lets not forget about those of us who need special attention. Stairs in mess hall makes it completely unusable for dimensionally disabled students (and we have 7 of them!). With your help, I certainly can change this. Are you for the bright future? Lets do something about that! I will convince the Principal to allow our Design Club to paint walls and fences (after we all have voted on coolest design, of course).%% Let me tell you why I am the best person for doing this job. Everyone knows I am a hard worker. I have strong will and proved myself as a reliable leader more than once. I have worked in Student Council for two years and know how to deal with school administration for everyones benefit. I have stood up for short skirts issue last year, and we won. Now we can win much more together! Tomorrow would be a great day for us all. Why? Because tomorrow is the day when the decision is ours: yours, mine, the boys next door. Lets do great changes together: vote for new bright school and elect me to the President! I will count on you as you have counted on me many times before! Jane Smith.

      Is gender equality very important in the Russia. I think that gender equality is very simular as in another European country. There are many women in leading roles in politics like minester of medicine or economic development, business, art and culture, but it could be said these women are over - achieving, and that most women do not share in this success. In 2013, men still earned 20 - 30 percent more then women. Yet 1941, when women worked in industry and manufacturing during World War 2, it must have seemed so different. After World War 2, many women started work as a teacher, doctor and accounter or bookkeeper. These position are women profesions now. And it is not like in another country.

      Interest in the use of renewable energy in the world is very large. Is no exception to our region. However, there are many obstacles to the development of ecological energy. First, in our region, very few days of sunshine a year. Over our area frequently hang low and thick clouds. If you use solar panels, this would be extremely inefficient because of lack of Sun. Secondly, our region is the lowlands. Here are rarely strong winds. The use of wind energy is very limited here. But windmills exist but their effectiveness is not great. Thirdly, harnessing the energy of the water here is impossible due to the flat topography. Dam construction usually is done in more affluent regions. If we talk about the use of biomass for conversion into energy, there is the possibility of environmental programs. But at the same time, the climate has its own peculiarities.Almost 9 months a year round with snow. Raising animals and their feeding is the problem. And this means that the production of biomass resources are always limited and dependent on the vagaries of the weather.However, experiments in environmental engineering are conducted today.

      Hyperbola The syncretic oral creative work had a fantastic content, along with embodiment, and the other side, following from the natural exaggeration of the phenomena of life in the collective consciousness of society. Due to poor development of its own powers by primitive people, embodying the forces of nature, of animals and plants, were represented by their much larger in size, more strong, and quick actions have often supernatural abilities. Exaggeration of the life of nature was substantial party to the primitive view, and from here and creativity. The word 'hyperbole' can be denoted in the literature, various parties and properties of artistic creativity. Under the '?????????????' in the broadest sense of the word - you can understand the main property of art consists in the creative typing characteristic phenomena of life, through which their character gets in artistic images are much clearer, condensed, the completed expression than in the phenomena of the real life. But hyperbole can be understood and already as one of the types of the verbal-the subject of expression, namely, that the characteristic phenomena of life greatly exaggerated in the images of art in its external dimensions, in its foreign efficiency and effectiveness. Finally, there are actually verbal hyperbole, usually created by metaphors and similes.%% For example, Gogol: 'a Rare bird will reach the middle of the Dnieper' is the subject of an exaggeration width of the Dnieper, expressed by many words; or: 'wonderful air and cool-?????, and full of bliss, and drives ocean fragrances' is a verbal metaphorical ?????????.???????? rich ????????????? primitive mythology. The most vivid example can serve the mythological representation of the ancient Scandinavians. Gods of the sky, 'aces' - Odin, Thor, and others - were infinitely mighty in all its manifestations. And the demigods, the earth, giants 'tours' were, in their eyes, so great is that the outside world was created from the body of one such giant, the founder of '??????' - Their-RA. Already in the heroic folk epic strong exaggeration fighting heroes expresses elevated emotional approval of their national values, in Russian epic 'Dobrynya and Vasily Konstantinovich' as depicted collision Dobrynia with the Tatars: Are ????????? ???????????, ??????????? ?????????, ??????????: The shoulders are so great sazhen, Between the eyes loud ??????, On the shoulders of ????????? as a beer boiler. Or: Became ?????????? ????????? push away... He grabbed a Tatar legs. He became Tatar waggle, He ????????? ????????????... In the early middle ages listeners epics could perceive such exaggeration with all the naive trust. In the future, especially since the Renaissance, hyperbole, like other traditional types of verbal subject of expression, turned into a means of expressing the actual artistic content. Especially hard it began to be used as the reception of creative typing comic characters in their humorous and satirical ??????????.???????? richly techniques hyperbole creativity Rabelais, later swift. Here as portrayed, for example, the life of a giant Gargantua, the son of king ?????????: 'after Breakfast as it should, Gargantua went to Church -- The Church defended 26 or 30 Dini... Next, ??????????? as it should, he sat at the table and, being on the nature phlegmatic, started his lunch with several dozen hams, smoked languages and sausage, eggs and other snacks prior to blame. At this time four of their servants one by one continuously threw him in the mouth full of blades mustard...' and so ?.?? and in the works of the romantic pathos verbally-subject ??????????? sometimes also becoming the reception of the image. Such, for example, the image of Hans-???????? in the novel Hugo, or images of the serpent and the eagle in the introduction to the poem Shelley 'the Revolt of Islam, or the image of Prometheus in poetic 'Symphony' Brusov 'Memory' In the works praising the heroism of popular uprisings, verbally-subject ??????????? is inherent feature of descriptiveness. For example, in 'Revolt' E. ???????? (translation Century Bryusov): Countless steps increasing the tramp Louder and louder in the ominous shadows, On the road in the coming days.

This segment of the retail market has been increased rapidly for the last ten years. Chains that sell consumer goods, like bread and butter, have increased much faster, but in my opinion, it depended on kind of goods. First of all, people want to eat and drink, and when these necessities have satisfied, people begin thinking about construction or renovation. There are some international and local DIY chains in Russia. Among international DIY chains there are French, British and German. Usually there is a big difference between local and international DIY chains. International DIY chains outlets nearly always are much larger than ones of local chains. Also international chains usually offer wider product range, lower prices and better service. I guess that local chains would like to offer the same conditions to their customers, but they just dont have so much money and cant afford it. Honestly speaking, I like buying in DIY chains, because its possible to buy everything what I need in the one place. So it isnt necessary to visit a lot of different shops.%% Just one outlet, lower prices and a huge product range!

      I graduated form the university and started working in the information technology sphere. This work seemed perfect to me because there was an illusion that information technologies were on the top of any technology. That was perfect at that time, because doing something new, developing extraordinary  things was rather interesting. Soon afterward I realized  that the things we had been doing all this time were useless. If I paid much attention to this fact I would have changed everything at that time. But I haven't found out it. The times passed and my attitude to my work changed dramatically. Something have happened with my career path. Sometimes it seemed to me that I had lost it at all.  If only I had known it at that times I would have chosen another career. But what has done is done. So I am trying something new every day to find out in my career something useful.

It seems that all this gadgets are making our life easier. Everyone has already noticed the changes. We can make a photo everywhere, public this photo in a social network and receive marks from other people. We can read news everywhere we like. We can work everywhere we want. That is good. But many world known companies that produce that devices in reality don't carry about making a person who owns that device as smart as his device. The company carries only about it's profits. That companies makes us being dependent on its gadget. Sometimes it seems that humanity sometimes looses its individuality precisely because of the &quot;smart technologies&quot;.

      In the Russia, educational of scool continue 11 years. But same students can study 9 clases, and after can go to the college. Who graduated 11 classes can go in the university. Children start their education in 6-7 years. And finished 16-17 years old. They study every day, and have only one holiday in the Sunday. It's hard. Nowadays the trend is to give tests to students more often. I guess that it not good idea for perfect education, because children talk a few, and can't speak.

There are many women who are really active in social life, and most women do not share in this success. Needless to say that the majority of women still earn less than man. If a man or a woman apply for the same kind of job a man will get it, not a woman! Besides, women have to run the house, look after the kids. Sometimes they do not have spare time for themselves.

      As you suggest I only just heard a song by Josh Woodward called Home Improvement. It is not my favorite style of music, so I cant say I found something interesting in the song for me. It is a simple song which has kind of a sentimental melody. The long lyrics are about former farmer who has moved to live to the city. It is not surprising that the farmer more liked living in the country in his 20$ house with million dollars view than 'to rent a trailer by the mall' in the town. He is not satisfied with such kind of his home improvement and sings about it with rough and not much of range voice.  Sometimes the voice is edgy and because of it and because of satiric lyrics the song doesnt have a relaxing mood. You can't dance to his song because there isn't much of a beat. You cant listen to it on date with your girlfriend because there is not any romantic there. I can recommend the song only if you are going to go to a hike or fishing and I suppose the song will be good for singing with a guitar around the campfire.%%

      I just listened to the song 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward. The melody is too simple, but it is a folk-rock tune, so it should be simple. The lyric isn't annoying, and easy for listening. Josh's voice isn't quite edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, only middle range without high and low peaks. It's quite mild. I didn't catch he hits a high or low notes, but maybe it's because of my headphones. The beat is very soft but makes me dance. I'm not sure about the mood of the song. Looks like he sing what he see. So, the song is not for my mood. I don't like such kind of lyric and beat. But I'm not disappointed in folk-rock because of this song, I think it could be a good thing for easy-listening, some kind of lounge music.

      The educatoin system in Russia have a some degrees. Secondary education (school) is a compulsory. Every young man must have high-school diploma. Graduates to sit for a Centralized Testing. I'm againts it, because  tests doesn't show a real knowledges. The results of Centralized Testing have the same status as the results of final examinations in schools and entrance examinations in universities. At the universities you can get degree of a bachelor (after 4 years) or of a master (after 5-6 years). Then you can continue education, if you want.

      Are there any differences between genders in Russia? Certainly! Nowadays men earns more money than women on the same position for the same job and with the same skills and experience. Sometimes the difference between men and women salary is 50%. When the rights for both genders will be equal? Unfortunatelly this question is not easy to answer, because russian govenment do almost nothing for rights equality in my country. So, I think that only russian women could change this awful situation. I am not a feminist, but even I believe that women have to grouped and be united fighting for their rights. Especially in Russia.

      The description of my lifestyle is probably the most complicated topic for me. I think about my life often. I can't say I have everything I have ever wanted. I don't have my own house or even apartment, so I have to live with my parents, but I have my own room at least, that is good already. Though I experience a certain amount of stress from living together. I don't have the husband as well. That fact makes me feel lonely sometimes. On the other hand I've got a very interesting job. I am a genealogist. I have a feeling that I can really help people with my work, and I enjoy to spend time with my colleagues. It's very important for me not to have a boss. I can choose my working hours myself, that helps me to spend more time with my son. The negative part of my work is the impossibility to have a certain amount of orders all the time. Sometimes it's enough, but sometimes I have to live from paycheck to paycheck. The most positive thing of my life is my son. The fact is my life is not always easy, however I wouldn't change anything.%% I even feel sorry for people who devoted their lives to work and money, and decided not to have children. I would like to have a full family with a husband and one more kid, but I hope nothing is missing yet.

      In my country there is five-day workweek. Each employee work about 40 hours a week. He should come to work on time and do all tasks before the deadline. Sometimes it may result in overwork. It is not very good because overwork may lead to increase diseases like depression, insomnia, overweight and other.Therefore, all employees have a break 1 hour, give or take, every working day. At this time is need to take a dinner, to drink a cup of tea or coffee or just to relax. If employee tired and want to relax, he may take approximately four weeks' vacation each year.

      The culture in my office isn't very formal. We can wear what we want, but managers prefer formal style. There are about 25 employees in the office, and I have good and friendly relationship with most of the others. We work 40 hours a week, take or give. We take two vacation in year. Usually, one in summer, and other in winter. Sometimes it's feels like I living here. I need to find healthy work-life balance. But when you young, you have a lot of energy and desire to lead some career goals. I hope that whan I get older I'll find the balance.

      Are men and women in Russia equal? I really don't think so. Nowadays women are at the better position than 100 years emansipes appeared. The women's fashion changed, women could talk about politics publicly, emansipes worked, they even could be a poetress or an artist. Then during the USSR history, women were free to study, work and making a career. Men and women were close to be equal. Nowadays the situation is not so happy. Sometimes it's difficult for women to find a good job because bosses don't want problems like absence because of babycare. So, there are many things need to be done for equality.
