      Hi Renee! Lets answer to your question, yes I already have gotten a copy of that TV survey. I belong to majority with my 2 TVs and to minority with my less then fife hour per week TV watching. So, never the less I am unemployed, I dont spend my time looking rubbishes. But if I want to be honest, I look sometime soup opera, but not regularly, because it gets boring. I agree with this part of survey, which states that my demographic usually watches the news , but I skip the weather, because the forecast is not enough reliable.By: Elena

On one hand they are very useful because they can connect us with anybody and we can find anything on the internet if there is an internet access. These gadgets are little enough to use and take them everywhere.  We can personalize them by setting and downloading useful programs on them. Their use become very easy with new platforms as Android with tapping on icons to open them. The smartphones and tablets have a lot of other function such as camera, watch,GPS. On the other hand they have disadvantages too. For example the Android platform is not stable. Sometimes it hangs on you can not to use one. They are look like expensive on the first sight. But  rate cost to benefit is much more better. You should not buy a big , expensive camera, GPS with his program, telephone and computer. The worst in these things is that the people are unnecessary around you
