According to the police, Salina Nelson said she didnt kill him, and just wanted him to stop shouting. Their neighbor Timothy McClure says he witnessed the entire incident from the window of his house. They argued and then Salina picked up a knife and thrust it to David. Salina was horrified. Salina had a reason to kill her husband. He made Salina mad because of his behaviors against her: he was usually kind and gentle, but he suddenly shouted and hit her after drinking. She often cried and came to Timothys house. Daves mother Marine says Salina was manipulating Dave. Dave was gentle. Marine was in the bathroom peacefully at that time, and suddenly heard a scream.

      Green business is important to me. If a business is truly green, then I think it is doing its part to be environmentally friendly. To be truly gerrn, a business should consider using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, or an office with a green roof. Businesses that sell green products have to conserve natural resources as much as possible by using organic, recycled and biodegradable materials in their products and packaging. I don't go out of my way to buy green products, but I will pay a lot more for certain items. It's not always easy to find truly green products in my neighborhood, and  I don't want to waste gasoline by driving around to byu green products. However, I am concerned about the food I eat, so I make sure to shop at green grocery stores. I'll sacrifice other luxuries in my life to make sure I'm eating healthy food. Of course, you have to take a company at its word that the product is truly green, when is why I buy from companies I know a lot about.

So to make sure that our employees are on the same page, we have to make something in common. Therefore I would like to propose that we shoud make M.V.V. M.V.V. means Mission, Vision, Value. Mission will help our employees to understand why our company exist, what we want to do through our business. And Vision will help our employees to understand which goal we should achieve. And Value will help our employees to make thier decision about daily business. In regard to important business decisions, management menbers would judge. But about daily business, management have to empower employees. If our employees have same value in common, their priority would be similer, and our company bring same quality to our customers.

      When I was a child, my parents always told me didnt waste time to do some no meaningless thing, and read more books. I tried to do what they told me. But I didnt think I was very happy at that time. I met my first love in my high school. I took a lot time to stay with him. I couldnt concentrate on my study, So I failed to enter a university first time. I took another year then went to university for continuing the study. I broken up with my boy friend, I have met the new faces, I dated someone, but I cant fall love in with each other as my first love. Sometimes Its a puzzle to me what kind of thing is the most important thing. What I am doing can be useful is the best thing I should do. For example, I work hard in the company that can contribute to the society. I stay with others that can share happy with them.

Century watches is a classic and famous brand and the owners of Century watch also are regarded as the people who is elegant and noble. Thats the reason why the Century watches are owned by the celebrity from various industries. The Century watches are also charming and glamour, it can bring the attraction and personal magnetism. Thats the reason why Century is the most well-known watchmaker worldwide. Considering Centurys trend of being with trendy younger, we contemplated the idea of bringing the trendy younger into the campaign. We decided, however, that attracting the trendy younger to have the watch was more important than anything. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a lady with a vine glass surrounding by the men, attractive and luxury, and with a slogan that delivers the most attractive message to let everyone has the Century watch. That is YOUR GLAMOUR, YOUR CENTURY.%% Were looking forward to getting any feedback from you about our decision.
